<h1>A Day Early</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m back from <span class="caps"><span class="caps">NYC</span></span> a day early, and despite my best intentions of getting right back to the office I instead caught up on the sleep deficit accrued this weekend.  It&#8217;s 85 degrees here in DC.  I can&#8217;t parse this fact, so sleeping until it&#8217;s <em>not</em> 85 degrees seemed like a good alternative.</p><br /><br />    <p>New York was beautiful.  I like the city more every time I&#8217;m there, and I used to not like it at all.  But the city itself wasn&#8217;t the feature of my weekend.</p><br /><br />    <p>People talk about online community a lot.  They talk about its potential for political change, cultural evolution, and economic optimization.  But you haven&#8217;t really seen the power of online community until you&#8217;ve seen this exchange:</p><br /><br />    <p><em>Person 1:</em> Hi, I&#8217;m Person 1.  I&#8217;m HandleFoo on the site.<br /><em>Person 2:</em> Ohmygod!  I&#8217;m HandleBar.  I&#8217;ve been waiting to meet you for ages!<br /><em>Person 1 and Person 2 hug.</em></p><br /><br />    <p>Imagine that over and over again.  People brought together in friendship by the smallest common thread.  It&#8217;s testament to the best part of human nature.  All we need is the excuse of commonality to treat each other with compassion and generosity.</p><br /><br />    <p>Also, I forgot my mobile&#8217;s charger in the hotel room, so don&#8217;t be miffed if you can&#8217;t call or txt me.</p>
