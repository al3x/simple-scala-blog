<p>I will be in <span class="caps"><span class="caps">NYC</span></span> from today through Monday afternoon.  Since the rest of The City is going to <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SXSW I</span></span> expect that it will be a pleasant and carefree time.</p><br /><br />    <p>Upon my return you can expect the same insightful, authoritative, and deeply personal blogging I&#8217;ve been delivering daily over the last two weeks.</p>
