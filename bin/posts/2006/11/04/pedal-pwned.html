<h1>Pedal Pwned</h1>
<p>My bike got stolen.  If you see anyone riding around Arlington on a maroon Novara Fusion, tackle &#8216;em.  And maybe think twice before leaving your bike locked up overnight at the Clarendon metro.  Yes, Clarendon.</p><br /><br />    <p>I didn&#8217;t particularly <em>like</em> the bike from an aesthetic perspective.  It got me places, but it didn&#8217;t have the relaxed ride I&#8217;d want from a commuter bike.  It was increasingly having little glitches, a bit premature given how new it was and the light riding I do.  Screws coming out, the handlebar loosening every couple rides, fittings coming off, the lights not working most of the time.</p><br /><br />    <p>But hey: that&#8217;s someone else&#8217;s problem now.  I hope you end up with a spoke through your lung, thief.</p>
