<h1>Human Testing, Unit Testing</h1>
<p>The Windows Vista team knows something about <a href="http://news.com.com/Vistas+last+mile+-+page+2/2009-1016_3-6133357-2.html">finding bugs</a> after all:</p><br /><br />    <blockquote><br />        <p>&#8220;Donnelly [who manages part of Microsoft&#8217;s Vista test operation] tries to do the opposite of what an IT manager would recommend.  He changes all the default settings, for instance. And instead of testing a clean installation on a new machine, he&#8217;ll try to upgrade an older model.  &#8216;You find bugs,&#8217; he said, &#8216;You absolutely find bugs that way.&#8217;&#8221;</p><br />    </blockquote><br /><br />    <p>It&#8217;s a start.</p><br /><br />    <p>The security guy in me has a hard time choking down the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">Unit Testing</a> doctrine.  Programmers don&#8217;t find deep bugs in their own code.  Machines don&#8217;t find deep bugs when running in a contrived development/testing environment.  These approaches find surface bugs, and that&#8217;s valuable, but they shouldn&#8217;t help you sleep at night.</p><br /><br />    <p>People doing dumb and/or malicious shit finds deep bugs.  You can&#8217;t script dumb and malicious.</p>
