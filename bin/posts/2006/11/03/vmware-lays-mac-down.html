<h1>VMware Lays the Mac Down</h1>
<p><a href="http://vmblog.com/archive/2006/10/17/2161.aspx">VMware Fusion</a> is the name of VMware&#8217;s Mac offering, currently in private beta.  &#8220;Somebody I know&#8221; had a copy running on his or her MacBook Pro and I couldn&#8217;t help but take a look.</p><br /><br />    <p>VMware Fusion is far more Mac-like than its direct competitor, <a href="http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/">Parallels</a>, not that that&#8217;s a high bar.  Fusion&#8217;s interface is simple, markedly more so than the Windows and Linux versions of VMware; when the &#8220;advanced installation options&#8221; are a choice between using a CD or an <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ISO</span></span> image we&#8217;re talking <em>basic</em> for virtualization software.</p><br /><br />    <p>The good news is that Fusion will work with your existing VMware images, not to mention all of their <a href="http://www.vmware.com/vmtn/appliances/">Virtual Appliances</a>.  The bad news is that the software doesn&#8217;t support snapshots, rendering it essentially identical to Paralells in testing usefulness, which is to say not very useful at all.  Snapshots are what <em>makes</em> VMware; they&#8217;re why we suffer its fits and starts (and shutdowns).  Without them, Fusion is a non-starter as a commercial product.</p><br /><br />    <p>Which isn&#8217;t to say that I wouldn&#8217;t rather use VMware over Parallels.  VMware really is synonymous with virtualization and I have an illogical and innate consumer trust in their brand and products.  If Fusion and Parallels are essentially the same product, I&#8217;ll use Fusion.  If one or another can deliver the advanced features of VMware 5 to my Mac, I&#8217;ll use that one.  Easy decision.</p><br /><br />    <p>Oh, and Fusion seems to be faster, even with the debugging checks hard-coded into this beta.  So that&#8217;s cool.</p>
