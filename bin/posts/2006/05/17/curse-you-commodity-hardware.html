<h1>Curse You, Commodity Hardware</h1>
<p>A few months back I wanted a home server to do several things:</p><br /><br />    <ol><br />    <li>Be a RAIDed file server with a bunch of big disks in it.</li><br />        <li>Run <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a> virtual machines.</li><br />        <li>Run a BitTorrent client all the time.</li><br />        <li>Serve up the occassional <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MP3</span></span> or archive to friends over the intarwebs.</li><br />    </ol><br /><br />    <p>I went to a local computer show and walked out in a matter of minutes with a deceptively plain beige box housing a fairly beefy <span class="caps"><span class="caps">AMD 64</span></span> sytem.  Until last week it dutifully performed the aforementioned tasks, all running on the Fedora distribution of Linux.</p><br /><br />    <p>But last week I got it into my head that I&#8217;d migrate my home storage to Sun&#8217;s <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/zfs/"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">ZFS</span></span></a>, a next-generation file system designed to protect data and easily expand to new cheap disks.  I consolidated all my media onto one drive, set that aside, and installed a recent build of Solaris 10 Express.  The install went smoothly and before long I&#8217;d turned a couple of big <span class="caps"><span class="caps">IDE</span></span> drives into a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ZFS</span></span> storage pool.</p><br /><br />    <p>Yesterday I bought an enclosure for the set-aside drive and got my MacBook Pro talking to it so I could copy my media over to the new storage pool.  But when I went to boot up my server, trouble.  The <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BIOS</span></span> got through the memory check and the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">IDE</span></span> device scan and then stopped.  No error codes, no beeping, no rebooting.  It just stopped.</p><br /><br />    <p>I spent my evening trying various configurations of the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">IDE</span></span> device chain before deciding that life was too short and putting the damn thing on Craigslist.  Even if I could find the magic configuration that got the machine working (as it had happily for months before) I&#8217;d be paranoid about it schizing out again.  Sigh.</p><br /><br />    <p>It&#8217;s not a big loss, though.  It was my intention to purchase a Mac mini as a home media center and that box can happily handle the additional above tasks.  I may compliment it with a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">NAS</span></span> solution like the <a href="http://buffalotech.com/products/product-detail.php?productid=133&#38;categoryid=25">Buffalo TerraStation</a> or just buy several big honkin&#8217; disks and let <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span> handle <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RAID</span></span> in software, despite the reportedly abysmal performance.  Either way using a Mac and/or an integrated storage solution beats the living hell out of troubleshooting commodity PC hardware any day of the week.</p><br /><br />    <p>If I can paraphrase an old adage about Linux: PCs are only cheap if your time is worthless.</p>
