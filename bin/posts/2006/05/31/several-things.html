<h1>Several Things</h1>
<p>Condensing events since my last posting into easily-digestable info-nuggets:</p><br /><br />    <ol><br />    <li>The network attached storage solution I settled on is the <a href="http://infrant.com/">Infrant ReadyNAS NV</a>, which I purchased diskless from <a href="http://www.eaegis.com/">Aegis</a>.  It arrived yesterday.  First impression: cute.  The disks I&#8217;m putting in it arrive today.  Review to appear in due time.</li><br />        <li><a href="http://www.seriousdjs.net/">Craig and I</a> are booked to play the <a href="http://beatresearch.com/">Beat Research</a> night in Boston in August and other gigs are falling into place.  We&#8217;ve been deep in practice mode the last few weeks.  A new mix will appear when we&#8217;re good and ready.  In the mean time, if you know of a quirky, friendly DJ night in your town, please let us know.  We don&#8217;t expect to be career DJs but we sure do like playing music for people.</li><br />        <li>I ran into an old high school friend the other night who&#8217;s apparently been reading this here blog on and off for the last several years.  If you&#8217;re a regular reader but rarely comment, please say hi.</li><br />        <li><a href="http://www.synergizement.com/blog/">Timoni</a> moved in with me on Monday.  I am, unqualified, the happiest guy.</li><br />    </ol>
