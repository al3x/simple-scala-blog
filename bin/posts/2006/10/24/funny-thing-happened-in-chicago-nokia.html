<h1>A Funny Thing Happened In The Chicago Nokia Concept Store</h1>
<p>The C4 coverage is coming, promise.  Now then.</p><br /><br />    <p>While in Chicago this past weekend we stopped into the Nokia concept store in the &#8220;Magnificent Mile&#8221; shopping district.  I got hands-on with a bunch of phones I thought I wanted but quickly realized I didn&#8217;t.  The N-Series phones are really crap: bulky things with sub-par displays.  I browsed some more traditional models but nothing grabbed me.</p><br /><br />    <p>As I was getting ready to leave, a gentleman adjacent to me asked a salesperson if they carry the Nokia <span class="caps"><span class="caps">E60</span></span>.  The salesperson replied that no, the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">E60</span></span> is a European model so they don&#8217;t carry it at this store.  I quickly piped up and said, &#8220;here, I have one in my pocket!&#8221;  The gentleman and his colleague inspected the phone, asking questions about its features, nodding approvingly the whole time.</p><br /><br />    <p>In front of the salesperson we had a discussion about where to purchase an unlocked version of the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">E60</span></span> for a reasonable price (<a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2219450">TigerDirect</a> is the answer).  Satisfied, the gentleman and his colleague left.  The salesperson glared at me before I rejoined my friends and went on my way.</p>
