<h1>Removing a SLVR</h1>
<p>A while back I said some nice things about the Motorola <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SLVR L7</span></span>.  That was my three-days-out-of-the-box impression.  I now firmly retract those nice things.  This is me glaring daggers at Motorola: <em>glare</em>.</p><br /><br />    <p>A phone that does as comparatively little as the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SLVR</span></span> should not crash; I&#8217;d like to say that phones in general shouldn&#8217;t crash but that&#8217;s simply not a realistic expectation these days.   The <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SLVR</span></span> should not stall indefinitely while trying to load your contacts list.  You shouldn&#8217;t be able to exhaust its memory by simply running a web browser.  You shouldn&#8217;t have to wonder whether or not your phone is actually receiving calls while it sits there, powered on, acting like nothing&#8217;s wrong.</p><br /><br />    <p>All those major technical issues are aside from the fact that the interface is horrific and misleading.  For example: I don&#8217;t expect to have a phonebook entry overwritten when I try to assign a number to speed dial.</p><br /><br />    <p>I know Motorola has a lousy reputation when it comes to mobiles, but I&#8217;m a firsthand experience kinda guy.  Now that I&#8217;ve had that firsthand experience you&#8217;ll be hard-pressed to catch me buying another Motorola phone.</p><br /><br />    <p>Problem is, there&#8217;s not a worthwhile alternative out there.  I&#8217;ve looked at the Blackberry Pearl hands-on and wasn&#8217;t impressed.  Ditto the current Samsung offerings (basically rip-offs of Motorola&#8217;s designs), the Sidekick 3, and the Nokia <span class="caps"><span class="caps">E62</span></span> that <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2006/10/04/nokia-e62-good-deal-for-150/">Web Worker Daily was touting</a>.  I&#8217;d leave my current carrier for a better phone <del>- at a loss, even -</del> but there just isn&#8217;t anything compelling on the market.</p><br /><br />    <p>Where oh where is the <a href="http://www.appleiphone.blogspot.com/">iPhone</a>?</p>
