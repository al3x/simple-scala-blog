<h1>Competition and Confidence</h1>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I was talking to two of the baristas at <a href="http://www.murkycoffee.com">Murky</a>.  Murky baristas regularly compete in regional competitions, and regularly win.  I asked how they were feeling about the upcoming Mid-Atlantic regionals.  One barista expressed humble good vibes about the event.  The other, a young woman:</p><br /><br />    <blockquote><br />        <p>&#8220;We are going to fuck their mouths.&#8221;</p><br />    </blockquote><br /><br />    <p>And that, my friends, is confidence.</p>
