<h1>The E Is For Enterprisey</h1>
<p>It took quite some amount of research but I finally found a phone with minimal suck.  It&#8217;s not, like, my dream phone, but it seems solid.  Reviews say it&#8217;s solid.  It&#8217;s got&#8230; solidity.  It&#8217;s the <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/phones/e60">Nokia <span class="caps"><span class="caps">E60</span></span></a>.</p><br /><br />    <p>The E series are business phones.  They are for <em>professional people</em>.  Sure they come with a media player but that&#8217;s where the fun stops.  There&#8217;s no camera.  No Flickr uploads.  No MyPhoneSpaceLifeLog.  No TuneRemixDJRingtone Asteroid Blaster 3D Turbo Edition.</p><br /><br />    <p>But you can read and write Microsoft Office documents.  On your phone.  Business.</p><br /><br />    <p>The <a href="http://feetup.org/wiki/NokiaE60"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">E60</span></span></a> is a candybar phone, unlike the BlackBerryish <a href="http://feetup.org/wiki/NokiaE61"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">E61</span></span></a> and its retarded American cousin the <a href="http://feetup.org/wiki/NokiaE62"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">E62</span></span></a>.  Shocking as it may seem, I don&#8217;t actually want a full keyboard on my phone.  I don&#8217;t want to be able to easily answer emails or compose novels in text message form.  If I want to do those things, I have a laptop, and my phone is right next to it most of the time.  I want a phone that compliments my laptop, not replaces it.</p><br /><br />    <p>The <span class="caps"><span class="caps">E60</span></span> still does some neat stuff for all its businesslike modest: wi-fi, <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EDGE</span></span>, landscape mode, a web browser that&#8217;s the same as Safari under the hood.  Plus, it can do anything Symbian Series 60 can do, which includes <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/python">Python</a> (albeit and old and busted version of Python).</p><br /><br />    <p>It should get here sometime next week, just in time to send my <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SLVR</span></span> on a long walk off a short pier.  Report after I&#8217;ve played with it for a few days.</p>
