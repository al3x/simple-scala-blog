<p>James Duncan Davidson <a href="http://blog.duncandavidson.com/2004/12/typepad_transit.html">had the right idea about blogging tools</a>:</p><br /><br />    <blockquote><br />        <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve putzed around way to[o] much with weblogging software over the years. It&#8217;s been fun and rewarding. But it&#8217;s taken away my concentration from other things I should be doing.&#8221;</p><br />    </blockquote><br /><br />    <p>That was in late 2004.</p><br /><br />    <p>Today I set up a Virtual Private Server with <a href="http://www.slicehost.com/">Slicehost</a> with the intention of moving this domain to it, as well as laying down foundation for some upcoming projects.  My logic was that having a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">VPS</span></span> would allow me to run whatever crazy-ass blog software or services I so chose.</p><br /><br />    <p>Halfway into the tedium of setting up my server I surveyed the world of hosted blogging for the first time in ages.  <a href="http://www.typepad.com">TypePad</a> still sucks.  <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> sucks harder, if that&#8217;s even possible.  But <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a> does not suck, and  just today they added support for custom domains.  This serendipity got me thinking.</p><br /><br />    <p>My email is now totally outsourced.  Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to do the same for blogging and the minimal file hosting needs I have for my domain?  No upgrades, no patches, just write when I feel like writing.  Always on and someone else&#8217;s problem.  Yeah.  <em>Yeah</em>.</p><br /><br />    <p>So I get all my entries imported into a WordPress.com blog.  I get the design looking halfway decent.  And that&#8217;s when I find out that WordPress.com currently doesn&#8217;t allow for both hosting a blog and receiving email at the same domain name.  This seems to defeat the purpose of such an offering entirely.  Bah.</p><br /><br />    <p>It&#8217;s really surprising that there&#8217;s not a mature hosted blogging offering in 2006.  Like, shocking.  What am I not getting?</p>
