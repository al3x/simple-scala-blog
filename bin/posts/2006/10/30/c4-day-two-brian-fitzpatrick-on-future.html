<h1>C4 Day Two: Brian Fitzpatrick on the future of Subversion</h1>
<p>The last full-fledged talk of the day was from Brian Fitzpatrick (aka Fitz), one of the lead developers of the <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> revision control system and, more recently, a force behind <a href="http://code.google.com/">Google Code</a>, Google&#8217;s open source project offering.  He&#8217;s apparently been giving various iterations of this talk for some time, and we were regaled with a decidedly future-facing selection of his thoughts.</p><br /><br />    <p>Fitz is a jovial and confident speaker as well as being a master of his niche technical domain.  He spent little time on the hoary past of version control (read: <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CVS</span></span>), and credited Subversion&#8217;s current dominance to robust bindings and focused project management.  He reiterated throughout the talk his strong belief in open source and the importance of community building therein.</p><br /><br />    <p>The Subversion team apparently has a policy of &#8220;no wanking&#8221;: that is, that Subversion isn&#8217;t an academic exercise in the latest version control fads.  Fitz showed a thorough understanding of those fads but has little patience for them; he described <a href="http://venge.net/monotone/">monotone</a> as &#8220;alien technology [...] string theory that happens to do version control&#8221; to a chorus of laughter.</p><br /><br />    <p>The feature foremost in Subversion&#8217;s near future is decidedly un-wanky: merge tracking.  The distant future of Subversion is a bit more interesting.  Distributed version control is in the cards, despite Fitz&#8217;s sentiment that it detracts from the metaphor of versioning server as a project&#8217;s community hub.  Offline commits, improved working copies and svn:externals, and the addition of an &#8220;obliterate&#8221; command are all high on the list of potential improvements, though.</p><br /><br />    <p>More exotic is Fitz&#8217;s designs on a new filesystem backend, incorporating indexing and searching.  Ideally it would be &#8220;timesafe&#8221; by versioning even metadata like properties, and allow for concurrent writes to take advantage of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTTP</span></span> pipelining and speed up checkins.  A unified, consistent, &#8220;elegant&#8221; object-oriented <span class="caps"><span class="caps">API</span></span> is also on Fitz&#8217;s mind, and maybe even a rewrite in C++ with a better build system and testing framework.</p><br /><br />    <p>The Q&#38;A opened with a question about the <a href="http://svk.bestpractical.com/">svk</a> distributed wrapper around Subversion, which Fitz described as being &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;stable&#8221; but &#8220;requiring, I think, all of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPAN</span></span>&#8221; to chuckles.  A long-standing bug that makes it difficult to work with Mac <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span> packages in Subversion was credited to communication problems at Apple.  Backporting WebDAV from Apache 2 to Apache 1.x was dismissed out of hand (and rightly so).  A question about offline commit support to multiple machines for code review purposes was answered with a recommendation to use branches and the <a href="http://www.orcaware.com/svn/wiki/Svnmerge.py">svnmerge.py</a> tool.</p><br /><br />    <p>Version control is a niche topic and, as Fitz admitted, a potentially dry one.  He did a great job keeping things funny and future-forward.</p><br /><br />    <p>[Update Nov 11 2006: corrected speaker&#8217;s name and position on distributed versioning.]</p>
