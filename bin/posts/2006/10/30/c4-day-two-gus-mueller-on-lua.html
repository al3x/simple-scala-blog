<h1>C4 Day Two: Gus Mueller on Lua integration</h1>
<p>The third session of the day was presented by Gus Mueller of <a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com">Flying Meat</a>, developer of VoodooPad and other Mac indie favorites.  Like Brent Simmons before him, Mueller did his presentation from VoodooPad.  Given that his presentation was about integrating a new technology into VoodooPad this had a nice meta effect.</p><br /><br />    <p>Mueller&#8217;s talk was on integrating the <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> scripting language into Cocoa applications.  VoodooPad Pro is designed to give users maximum flexibility to organize and manipulate their data, and a programmatic solution is clearly the best fit.  Mueller advocated scripting languages for their lack of a compile cycle and the ease of runtime manipulation, and Lua in particular for its speed, easy integration with C/Objective-C, and increasing industry support particularly in the gaming domain.</p><br /><br />    <p>Lua has a number of interesting characteristics, we learned.  It&#8217;s written in <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ANSI C</span></span> and compiles more or less everywhere.  It offers dynamic typing, automatic garbage collection, and thread safety.  Its speed comes in part from a simple register-based VM and the use of pointers for string comparison (all strings are unique).  The language has no array construct, just &#8220;tables&#8221; which can be accessed via dot or bracket syntax and which are enumerated from one rather than the conventional zero.  Other oddities include the use of <tt>~=</tt> for negation rather than <tt>!=</tt> (though functions can be renamed) and the limitation of a single file handle at a time.</p><br /><br />    <p>Mueller demonstrated simple code for vanilla C integration, and suggested both <a href="http://www.pixelballistics.com/Software/LuaObjCBridge/">LuaObjCBridge</a> and his own LuaCore libary for Objective-C integration.  We were then treated to a demo of adding a Lua scripting menu to TextEdit, which took a staggeringly small amount of code.  With the demo complete and the talk having gone quickly, Mueller sheepishly opened up the floor for questions.</p><br /><br />    <p>One of the first questions was, of course, &#8220;why not AppleScript?&#8221;  After all, AppleScript is designed expressly for allowing application developers to extend functionality and customization to motivated users via a simple syntax.  But Mueller shot back the equally obvious answer to this obvious question: AppleScript is ugly.  Other scripting languages were brought up as well, including Python and F-Script.  But Python takes too long to load according to Mueller, and can&#8217;t be sandboxed to his liking.  F-Script was shot down mostly for aesthetic reasons.  Audience members rushed in to defend Python but Mueller is sold on Lua&#8217;s ease of integration and performance, and understandably so.</p><br /><br />    <p>A nice talk, if a little short on content that&#8217;s not readily available on Google.</p>
