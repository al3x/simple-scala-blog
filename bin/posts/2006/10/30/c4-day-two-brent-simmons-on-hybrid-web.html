<h1>C4 Day Two: Brent Simmons on Hybrid Web + Desktop Applications</h1>
<p>My sincere apologies for not getting to this sooner.  It was my intention to have my thoughts on day two of <a href="http://c4.rentzsch.com/0/">C4</a> up right after the conference ended.  Instead, it&#8217;s been over a week, which makes this all but irrelevant in intarwub time.  Hopefully someone will still find this useful.  Let&#8217;s get right into the first talk of the day.</p><br /><br />    <p><a href="http://www.ranchero.com">Brent Simmons</a> opened up the second day with his talk on melding desktop and web applications, presented straight from <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad.html">VoodooPad</a>.  The talk needed little introduction, as the number of applications that talk to web applications or services is visibly expanding: feed readers, remote storage, content management systems of various stripes.  As Simmons pointed out, desktop applications can offer better performance and responsiveness, richer editing, and cooler visualizations.</p><br /><br />    <p>The bulk of Simmons&#8217; talk was spent on the nitty-gritty of making web integration happen from the Mac developer&#8217;s perspective.  &#8220;If Apple thinks it&#8217;s cool they&#8217;re going to support it&#8221; said Simmons, and Apple&#8217;s support of web technologies in Cocoa is decent and improving, with <a href="http://webkit.org/">WebKit</a> as the foremost example.  Some excellent tips were passed along, such as that developers can manipulate the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DOM</span></span> through Cocoa, which was news to me.  Simmons touched on security (don&#8217;t trust external data), web services (the cool kids like <span class="caps"><span class="caps">REST</span></span>), <span class="caps"><span class="caps">XML</span></span> parsing (don&#8217;t rely on the CoreFoundation <span class="caps"><span class="caps">XML</span></span> parser) syncing (&#8220;no fun&#8230; boring as hell&#8221;), the challenges of offering support for popular software.</p><br /><br />    <p>The Q&#38;A had some real gems, including a screenshot of <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire">NetNewsWire</a> 3 that showed strong influences from <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/">OmniWeb</a>.  Simmons owned up to doing nothing more than templated strings for his <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SOAP</span></span> support, which got a big knowing laugh.  Someone else asked the question I had in mind: what did he think of the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/atompub-charter.html">Atom Publishing</a> protocol?  Simmons had a pragmatic answer: &#8220;I hope it&#8217;s good, and I hope the cool kids use it.  I just wanna deliver cool stuff to users.  I just write the code.&#8221;  Simmons&#8217; good humor was in evidence throughout the session, for example when commenting on Bonjour support in his primary product: &#8220;there&#8217;s a bug where it kinda just doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221;</p><br /><br />    <p>There was a brief dicussion of various data storage approaches before the end of the Q&#38;A, in which we learned that Simmons decided CoreData was was overkill given that NetNewsWire&#8217;s data is essentially a &#8220;flat list&#8221;.  Instead, he ended up using <a href="http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2005/3/22.html">Gus Mueller&#8217;s SQLite wrapper</a>.</p><br /><br />    <p>This was an excellent talk.  Simmons got right into what developers needed to know about his topic and managed to be entertaining, informative, and pleasant.  A great start to the day.</p>
