<h1>C4 Wrapup</h1>
<p>I can&#8217;t recommend C4 enough.  It was a great conference in a great location at a great price, and a fantastic argument for keeping such events small and focused.  It felt like a classroom, or rather like the sort of classroom I wish I&#8217;d had access to during my eduction.  The long Q&#38;A sessions and open dialog amongst speakers and attendees was supremely valuable.  Hell, even the food was good.  It&#8217;s hard to ask for much more.</p><br /><br />    <p>I&#8217;ll be back next year without a doubt.  Hats off to <a href="http://www.rentzsch.com/">Wolf</a> for putting it all together.</p>
