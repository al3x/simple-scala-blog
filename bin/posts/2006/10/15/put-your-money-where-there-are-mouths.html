<h1>Put Your Money Where There Are Mouths To Feed</h1>
<p>Tim Shey has the <a href="http://shey.net/reblog/2006/10/charity_as_mark.html">right idea</a> about Apple&#8217;s bright red <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/red/">charityPod</a>:</p><br /><br />    <blockquote><br />        <p>&#8220;[...] we?ve figured out a way to make 100% of the cost of your red nano go directly to relief in Africa. You simply have to skip buying the nano and donate the money directly to a grassroots organization working on the problem.&#8221;</p><br />    </blockquote><br /><br />    <p>I find charity promotions like the red iPod, not to mention charity events/walks/dinners/auctions, to be inescapably creepy and inefficient.  I understand that their objective is to generate money for charity where there would have been none.  However, encouraging people to donate when they get a fancy trinket or an elegant evening in return dilutes a culture of no-strings-attached giving.  It makes charity out to be a market transaction, when in fact it&#8217;s an act that inherently defies market values.</p>
