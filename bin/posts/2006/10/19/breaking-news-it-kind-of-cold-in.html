<h1>Breaking News: It's Kind Of Cold In Chicago</h1>
<p>Landed in Chicago this morning a bit ahead of schedule.  Getting to the airport bloody early can have its advantages.</p><br /><br />    <p>We had a delicious brunch at <a href="http://chicago.citysearch.com/profile/11549946/">Orange</a>: pumpkin pancakes, fresh orange-carrot juice, and frushi.  I&#8217;m presently in one of the much-touted <a href="http://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/">Intelligentsia Coffee</a> locations.  Their barista skills are confirmed; my espresso macchiato was excellent.</p><br /><br />    <p>Today we&#8217;re bumming around Bucktown, then seeing some improv at <a href="http://www.secondcity.com/">Second City</a> before dinner at <a href="http://www.adobogrill.com/">Adobo Grill</a>.  Tomorrow we take an architectural boat tour of the city before <a href="http://rentzsch.com/c4/">C4</a> kicks into gear.</p><br /><br />    <p>I&#8217;ll try to blog as much of the conference as time, facilities, and circumstances allow.  If I can live blog, I will.  If I can&#8217;t, expect posts the next morning for the conference&#8217;s respective days.</p><br /><br />    <p>I hope I packed enough warm stuff.  It&#8217;s nippy.</p>
