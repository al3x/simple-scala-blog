<h1>Mac Crashes, More</h1>
<p>My MacBook Pro has been slow and quirky for the past week.  Yesterday I had to hard reboot twice.  The second time made my machine decidedly unhappy: just about everything running decided to forget its preferences.  That meant all my Inquisitor shortcuts were gone; my news feeds were gone; my iTunes library was hosed.  A recent backup made this less of a problem than it could have been, but it was still a hassle.</p><br /><br />    <p>After restoring my files, I took the opportunity to track down the root of my machine&#8217;s instability.  As it turn out, <a href="http://www.unsanity.com/haxies/ape">Application Enhancer</a> was running, most likely installed by <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/">Airfoil</a>.  <span class="caps"><span class="caps">APE</span></span> being a notorious cause of instability, I eschewed it post-haste.   Things have been less strange since.</p><br /><br />    <p>I also disabled FileVault and secure virtual memory, which was painful.  I&#8217;ve read countless times that FileVault isn&#8217;t <em>supposed</em> to degrade performance but experience has consistently shown me otherwise.  A pity.</p><br /><br />    <p>As much as I enjoyed the incredible flexibility and OS integration of <a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/">Voodoo Pad</a>, it does more than I realistically need.  As soon as I started using it to build an &#8220;outboard brain&#8221; I realized that I prefer to collect information and synthesize it into coding, writing, or some other activity.  Passive collection of anything more than bookmarks just isn&#8217;t my style.</p><br /><br />    <p>I&#8217;ve gone back to using a &#8220;Life&#8221; project in <a href="http://www.macromates.com">TextMate</a> for short-term notes, numbers, ideas, and so forth.  Not having to worry (read: not being able to worry) about styling text, quirky list behavior, and other <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RTF</span></span> oddities is a burden lifted.  <a href="http://www.petermaurer.de/nasi.php?section=witch">Witch</a> makes getting to that project that much easier and <a href="http://www.ianhenderson.org/megazoomer.html">Megazoomer</a> lets me focus on TextMate and only TextMate.</p><br /><br />    <p>I find the combination of blogging and <a href="http://del.icio.us/al3x">del.icio.us</a> to be a fine outboard brain, but I need more granularity than the broad categories that TextPattern allows.  Tagging may be the feature that forces me to migrate yet again.</p>
