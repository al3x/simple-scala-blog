<h1>What's Wrong With Typo</h1>
<p>(A commenter on my Typo export script asked what&#8217;s wrong with Typo.  I started to reply with another comment but it grew into this.)</p><br /><br />    <p>What&#8217;s wrong with <a href="http://www.typosphere.org/">Typo</a>?  Lots of stuff.</p><br /><br />    <p>Typo started out on the right foot: a lithe Rails blog engine with no web-based administration; all posting, editing, and deleting of articles was done via <span class="caps"><span class="caps">XML</span></span>-RPC, presumably via a desktop blog editing app like <a href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>.  This kept the code base small and the user base smaller, which meant that the only features getting added were must-haves for serious bloggers, not something-for-everyone niceties.</p><br /><br />    <p>When Rails started to take off, fans got a bad case of &#8220;everything on the same platform&#8221; syndrome.  Even though there are stellar, battle-tested blogging packages that are far easier to deploy and maintain, every Rails newbie under the sun decided that their first project was going to be setting up a Typo blog and chronicling their adventures in Ruby-land.  With this influx of users came the desire for a snazzy administration interface and about a billion other features.  Typo got bloated in a big way.</p><br /><br />    <p>The main problem with Typo, though, is that it&#8217;s a Rails app, and Rails apps require more hand-holding than your middle school girlfriend.  Memory leaks, lingering sessions, caching issues, zombie processes, and all sorts of badness are (or were) de rigeur in the Rails world.  That&#8217;s fine when you&#8217;re developing and administering a production application because it&#8217;s usually your full-time job to look after it.  But you shouldn&#8217;t have to be a full-time admin for your blogging software.  Blogging software should install-and-forget, case closed.</p><br /><br />    <p>No wonder, then, that one person eager for my export script said, &#8220;Typo&#8217;s been blowing goats.&#8221;  Strong words, friends.  Strong words.</p>
