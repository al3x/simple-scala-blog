<h1>La Bicyclette</h1>
<p>I bought a bicycle this weekend, a <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/47970934.htm">Novara Fusion</a>.  For being <span class="caps"><span class="caps">REI</span></span>&#8217;s house brand Novara makes quite nice bikes.</p><br /><br />    <p><a href="http://steeltoe.org/">Ben</a> helped me pick it out, and aptly described it as &#8220;having this grrrr city bike <em>Mad Max</em> thing going on.&#8221;  It&#8217;s that, but it&#8217;s also kind of old-timey in its colors and styling.  What I like best is that it came ready to be a total car replacement; with a good bag and some paniers there&#8217;s very little that one couldn&#8217;t haul on the Fusion that one couldn&#8217;t have delivered instead.</p>
