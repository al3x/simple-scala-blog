<h1>So Much For Importing</h1>
<p>I gave up on my <a href="http://al3x.net/2006/04/22/keeping-it-first-world">aggravated wait for a new mobile</a> this weekend.<br />The Nokia I wanted was never going to reach these shores for a reasonable price, I realized.  This was confirmed when I went to get a new phone:</p><br /><br />    <blockquote><br />        <p>Me: So I&#8217;m guessing Cingular is never going to carry the Nokia <span class="caps"><span class="caps">N73</span></span>, right?<br />Cingular Guy: Oh, no.  They don&#8217;t go in for the high-end stuff.  Not when they&#8217;re trying to watch the bottom line.<br />Me: Dang.</p><br />    </blockquote><br /><br />    <p>Importing was looking to be too damned expensive.  An unlocked Nokia <span class="caps"><span class="caps">N80</span></span>, cousin to the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">N73</span></span>, runs upwards of $600.  &#8220;WebKit-powered browser:http://opensource.nokia.com/projects/S60browser/ and <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/python">Python on your phone</a> aside, that&#8217;s insanity.  The gadget cycle is just too short to justify that kind of layout.</p><br /><br />    <p>So I bought a <a href="http://www.motorola.com/motoinfo/product/details.jsp?globalObjectId=86">Motorola <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SLVR L7</span></span></a>.  It&#8217;s svelte, it&#8217;s sturdy, it&#8217;s reasonably priced, and it&#8217;s kinda slick.  It&#8217;s even turning out to be a good power user phone.</p><br /><br />    <p>All the Bluetooth functionality plays nice with Mac <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span>, iSync, and <a href="http://www.reelintelligence.com/BluePhoneElite/">BluePhoneElite</a>.  <a href="http://moto4lin.sourceforge.net/wiki/Main_Page">moto4lin</a> works after some monkeying [1], and allows one to add, edit, and delete most anything on the phone, even those dumb &#8220;unerasable&#8221; images the providers slap on there.  Since the phone sports <span class="caps"><span class="caps">J2ME</span></span> support, you can cop the surprisingly nice <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/operamini/">Opera Mini</a> and have a decent browser at your disposal.  Not too shabby.</p><br /><br />    <p>The <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SLVR</span></span> is also the first phone I&#8217;ve had with <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MP3</span></span> ringtones.  I&#8217;m sure the novelty will ware off eventually, but for now hearing Barrington Levy whenever I get a call puts a smile on my face.</p><br /><br />    <p>[1] Getting moto4lin compiled on 10.4.6 is major suck.  Don&#8217;t bother.  Follow the directions for installing libusb and <span class="caps"><span class="caps">QT 3</span></span>.3 <a href="http://moto4lin.sourceforge.net/wiki/Mac_OS_X">here</a>, then just download the pre-built binary at the bottom of the page.  Despite all the weird shit it&#8217;s linked against and being a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PPC</span></span> binary <em>and</em> being like seven months old, it works fine between my MacBook Pro and <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SLVR</span></span> with the exception of the Java app pane.  Still, it&#8217;s more than enough to get pre-installed off your phone and skins, wallpapers, and so forth.</p>
