<h1>The Great Typo Escape</h1>
<p>I guess a lot of people are sick of <a href="http://www.typosphere.org">Typo</a>.  I&#8217;ve had a number of emails in the last couple months asking me for the script I used to get my entries and comments out of Typo and into TextPattern.  Poor souls.</p><br /><br />    <p>Until recently most of my at-home geek time was devoted to Kenshoto, but now I&#8217;m freed up to work on lil&#8217; side projects like this.  So, without further ado, here&#8217;s how to get the heck outta Typo:</p><br /><br />    <h3>Part 1: Exporting to Moveable Type Format</h3><br /><br />    <ol><br />    <li>Download <del><del>mt_export.rb</del></del> (ed: sorry, this file was lost ages ago!).</li><br />        <li>Copy it to the <tt>scripts</tt> directory of your Typo installation.</li><br />        <li>From a command line, change to the <tt>scripts</tt> directory and run my export script, piping the output to a new file: <tt>ruby mt_export.rb &gt; import.txt</tt></li><br />        <li>Set the new <tt>import.txt</tt> file aside somewhere safe.</li><br />        <li>Install TextPattern.</li><br />    </ol><br /><br />    <h3>Part 2: Importing</h3><br /><br />    <ol><br />    <li>Once you have TextPattern installed, bring up the <tt>admin</tt> section and open the <tt>import</tt> tab. </li><br />        <li>Read the help text that comes up when you click on the lil&#8217; question marks.</li><br />        <li>Move <tt>import.txt</tt> to the directory specified in the help text: <tt>/textpattern/include/import</tt></li><br />        <li>Do a &#8220;Moveable Type (File)&#8221; import.  It went well, right?</li><br />    </ol><br /><br />    <h3>Part 3: Cleaning Up</h3><br /><br />    <p>(TextPattern is awesome but it&#8217;s not so smart about importing.  It&#8217;ll suck in new comments just fine but it won&#8217;t update its internal count of how many comments each post has recieved.  When you look at your blog, it&#8217;ll look like there&#8217;s no comments.  This fixes that.)</p><br /><br />    <ol><br />    <li>Download <a href="http://code.al3x.net/svn/scraps/textpattern/txp_update_comment_count.php" title="txp_update_comment_count.php">txp_update_comment_count.php</a> to the server you&#8217;re working on.</li><br />        <li>Edit the commented variables to contain your database connection settings.</li><br />        <li>Run the damn thang: <tt>php txp_update_comment_count.php</tt></li><br />        <li>If you see it figuring out how many comments each post has associated with it, you&#8217;re set.</li><br />    </ol><br /><br />    <p>Hope that puts you on the path to blog unsuckage.  Lemme know if something breaks!</p>
