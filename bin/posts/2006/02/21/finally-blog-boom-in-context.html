<h1>Finally, The Blog Boom in Context</h1>
<p>Trevor Butterworth&#8217;s recent article in the Financial Times, <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/384be1be-9eb1-11da-ba48-0000779e2340.html">Time for the last post</a>, is required reading for anyone interested in the phenomenon of blogging.  While his primary concern is for the more journalistic form of blogging that&#8217;s become most visible in the last several years, it&#8217;s essentially the best introduction, exploration, and criticism of the blogging world I&#8217;ve yet seen.</p><br /><br />    <p>The piece is rich in historical and economic context, and its author isn&#8217;t willing to accept either the blog-saturated future that proponents envision or the &#8220;passing fad&#8221; rebuttals.  Butterworth knows just where blogging seems destined to end up: right alongside other media formats, but never surpassing them.  He scrys the blog format with an inherent handicap: its valuing of speed <del>- &#8220;time to press,&#8221; if you will -</del> over quality.  There is the occasional blogger whose patience and craftsmanship defies this, but for the kind of popular blog Butterworth is concerning himself with, he&#8217;s spot on.</p><br /><br />    <p>Apropos to none of the above, my absolute favorite quote:</p><br /><br />    <blockquote><br />        <p>?Satire,? said Choire Sicha, ?is the most useless cultural effluvia one could possibly produce out of the cultural situation in America right now.?</p><br />    </blockquote><br /><br />    <p>That more or less sums up the anti-snark post I&#8217;ve been sitting on since&#8230; when did the Gawker sites get big?</p>
