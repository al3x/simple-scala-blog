<h1>Happy Valentine's Day</h1>
<p><img src="/images/1.jpg" title="My Bloody Valentine - Loveless album cover" alt="My Bloody Valentine - Loveless album cover" /></p><br /><br />    <p>...or, as I like to call it, International Lonely Shoegazers Have An Ironic Listen Of &#8220;Loveless&#8221; Day.</p><br /><br />    <p>Seriously, you should listen to this record anyway.  It&#8217;ll change the way you think about music, and probably explain where a few of your favorite bands got their ideas.</p><br /><br />    <p>Unrelated, the older I get and the longer I&#8217;m single, the more I like hearing stories of happy couples.  Pretty soon I&#8217;m going to be <del>renting</del> stealing romantic comedies and crying at weddings and so forth.</p><br /><br />    <p>Listen to the record already.</p>
