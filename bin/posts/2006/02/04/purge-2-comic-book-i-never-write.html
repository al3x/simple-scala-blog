<h1>Purge 2: A Comic Book I'll Never Write</h1>
<p>Setting: Tehran, just after <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4543720.stm">Iran bans Western music</a>.</p><br /><br />    <p>Plot: a bunch of kids are trying to throw Tehran&#8217;s best leftfield dance night.  Youth and art clashes with politics and faith, the importation/exportation/reinterpretation of culture is explored via dubplates and massive choons, someone falls in love, we all learn something over two or three 20-odd page issues.</p><br /><br />    <p>Art: ideally, a different artist for each arc of the story.  Lots of postmodern riffing on Islamic motifs, repeating patterns skewered with Western iconography.  Sketchy, heavy outlines, fluid movement.  &#8216;Nuff hott Iranian girls.  <a href="http://www.digi-digi.net/">Darkpony</a>.</p>
