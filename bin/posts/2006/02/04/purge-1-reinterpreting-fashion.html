<h1>Purge 1: Reinterpreting Fashion</h1>
<p>From a <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/imomus/107531.html">post on Momus?s LJ</a>:</p><br /><br />    <blockquote><br />        <p>And because the clothes have all been pre-worn, you know that your costume references aren?t just allusions: they?re the actual clothes the actual people you?re referring to actually wore.</p><br />    </blockquote><br /><br />    <p>No.</p><br /><br />    <p>The history of an object (like clothing) is all but negated when recontextualized (ie, worn).  See found art, sampling, etc. wherein the object&#8217;s history becomes just another element of the overall piece, akin to noting tone or texture in a larger compostion.</p><br /><br />    <p>Wearing the blood-stained shirt of an executed revolutionary does not make you a revolutionary; you?re just a guy in a bloody shirt.  Unless you go around telling everyone about your bloody shirt and where you got it.</p><br /><br />    <p>Fashion is a performance for an audience that doesn?t know they?re an audience.</p>
