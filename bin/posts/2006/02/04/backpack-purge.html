<h1>Backpack Purge</h1>
<p>I have a semi-rational fear that  <a href="http://www.backpackit.com/">Backpack</a> is going to explode/disappear at any minute.  I&#8217;ve been relying on it as an everpresent digital scrapbook for about six months now.   All I ever store is text, though.  No need for a wacky web app to store a bunch of text.</p><br /><br />    <p>The next several posts are things that&#8217;ve been sitting around in my Backpack for ages.  Having a nice place to put things means you&#8217;re entirely too likely to file-and-forget.</p>
