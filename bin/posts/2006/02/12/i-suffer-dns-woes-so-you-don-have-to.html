<h1>I Suffer DNS Woes So You Don't Have To</h1>
<p>Of late I ran into an issue that I think a fair number of geeks have: how to use the same name for your home server wherever you are.</p><br /><br />    <p>Lots of you have servers at home and a laptop that you use to talk to that server when you&#8217;re at the coffee shop, on the road, at the office, and so forth.  That server is probably on a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DSL</span></span> or cable connection, and thus you&#8217;ve assigned a name to it via dynamic <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DNS</span></span>.  That works great when you want to talk to the server from the coffee shop.  But when you&#8217;re at home, no worky, right?  You&#8217;re all &#8220;hey connect to myserver.dyndns.com&#8221; and your router is all &#8220;durr hurr that&#8217;s at the same address that I&#8217;m connected to and I can&#8217;t move your packets there hurr&#8221; and you&#8217;re all &#8220;crap.&#8221;</p><br /><br />    <p>So maybe you could get buck wild and set up <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BIND</span></span> or <a href="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html">djbdns</a> or another full-fledged <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DNS</span></span> server.  That&#8217;s overkill, though.  All you really want is a piece of software running at home that says &#8220;if someone asks where these couple of computers are, tell them they&#8217;re right here on this network, otherwise pass the question on to my <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ISP</span></span>&#8217;s nameserver.&#8221;  That piece of software is <a href="http://dproxy.sourceforge.net/">dproxy</a>, and it totally owns.</p><br /><br />    <p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;cha do:</p><br /><br />    <ol><br />    <li>Download dproxy to your server.  Decompress it and read the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">README</span></span> file.</li><br />        <li>Build and install it.</li><br />        <li>Add the machines on your network to your server&#8217;s /etc/hosts file.</li><br />        <li>Edit the dproxy configuration file so that it talks to your favorite nameserver and (probably) doesn&#8217;t use <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PPP</span></span>.</li><br />        <li>Start dproxy.</li><br />        <li>Tell the machines on your network to use your server&#8217;s IP as a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DNS</span></span> server.  On UNIXish systems this means adding it to the top of your /etc/resolv.conf file.  Don&#8217;t forget that on your server you&#8217;ll be adding 127.0.0.1, not your server&#8217;s network-facing address.</li><br />        <li>Try talking to myserver.dyndns.com from home.  Worky?</li><br />        <li>If something&#8217;s messed up, make sure your server&#8217;s firewall is allowing <span class="caps"><span class="caps">TCP</span></span> and <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UDP</span></span> traffic on port 53, that you told dproxy about a working nameserver, and that you sacrificed a virgin.</li><br />    </ol><br /><br />    <p>Hopefully that wasn&#8217;t too painful.  I didn&#8217;t think so, at least not compared to setting up other <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DNS</span></span> softaware.  On my <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora</a> box, dproxy even installed a handy startup script.  It worked <em>instantly</em>.  It is love.</p><br /><br />    <p>The main impetus for this, by the way, was Subversion, which doesn&#8217;t offer a brainless way to say &#8220;my server is usually at myserver.dyndns.com, but if you can&#8217;t talk to that machine, try 192.168.0.2&#8221;.  But that&#8217;s all sorted now.  Huzzah!</p>
