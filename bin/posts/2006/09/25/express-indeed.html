<h1>Express Indeed</h1>
<p>Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/">Airport Express</a> is hardly new tech, but bear with me here.</p><br /><br />    <p>Our apartment has two laptops that want to play music and one set of speakers that&#8217;s inconvenient to both of said laptops.  We already have a wireless network.  We also have a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">USB</span></span> printer that doesn&#8217;t share nicely over my <a href="http://www.infrant.com">ReadyNAS NV</a>.</p><br /><br />    <p>So I buy an AirPort Express.  I plug it in to one of the Ethernet ports on my existing router, a Linksys <span class="caps"><span class="caps">WRT54GL</span></span> running alternative firmware.  I plug in the printer.  I tell the Express not to talk wireless, just to hang out on my network and play music and share the printer.</p><br /><br />    <p>That&#8217;s it.  It works.  Playing music to a set of speakers across the room.  Playing other stuff, too, thanks to <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/">AirFoil</a>.  Printing.</p><br /><br />    <p>This makes me happy.  Wireless anything still has a sense of magic when it works.  The Express manages to be magical and still play nice with decidedly unmagical, unsexy network setups.</p><br /><br />    <p>Money well spent.</p>
