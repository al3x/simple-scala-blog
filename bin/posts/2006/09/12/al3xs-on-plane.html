<h1>al3xs On A Plane</h1>
<p>We leave for London later today, and I get to re-discover the joys of red eye flights, albeit with Jack Daniels and melatonin this time around (I was maybe 15 last time I went to the UK).  Wednesday we do touristy stuff, Thursday and Friday I&#8217;m at <a href="http://europe.railsconf.org">RailsConf Europe</a> while Timoni explores the city on her own, and then tourism resumes for me over the weekend.  We return next Tuesday.</p><br /><br />    <p>I&#8217;m happy with how my talk for RailsConf has come together.  There looks to be lots of good content at the conference, and I&#8217;m happy they finally <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/9/9/railsconf-europe-sold-out-and-almost-here">sold out</a>.  It&#8217;ll be interesting to see the differences between hacker cons and more, uh, &#8220;professional&#8221; conferences.</p><br /><br />    <p>On the same topic, I&#8217;m registered to attend the aforementioned-on-this-blog <a href="http://c4.rentzsch.com/0/">C4</a> conference in Chicago next month.  I hope I&#8217;m not taking a slot from a real actual Mac developer, but I&#8217;ll try to make up for that by noteblogging the hell out of the respective talks.</p><br /><br />    <p>It&#8217;s nice to be traveling regularly again!</p>
