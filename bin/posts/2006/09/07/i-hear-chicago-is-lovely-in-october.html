<h1>I Hear Chicago Is Lovely In October</h1>
<p>I would pretty much kill to be at the <a href="http://c4.rentzsch.com/">C4</a> event next month.  I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s invite-only or what, but there&#8217;s a bunch of smart people I respect lined up to talk.  Plus, I keep hearing how nice Chicago is, mostly from <a href="http://www.yarnballs.com">Brittany</a>.</p><br /><br />    <p>I periodically tell myself that I&#8217;ll become a Mac developer if I get sick of web application development.  Apple definitely makes developing on <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span> sound sexier with every release.  The upcoming <a href="http://andymatuschak.org/articles/2006/08/27/clues-to-objective-c-2-0">changes to Objective-C</a> sound like they&#8217;ll address some of the language&#8217;s idiosyncrasies.</p>
