<h1>Civic Action</h1>
<p>Last week my PowerBook&#8217;s hard drive failed.  Only a year and a half old, but that&#8217;s the way it goes.  I promptly replaced the drive and sold the machine to a friend; the lure of a new MacBook was simply too great.</p><br /><br />    <p>But when I got my shiny new machine home, all was not well.  There was, apparently, a young asp trapped just below the left speaker grille.  My new MacBook <em>hissed</em> at me.  Had I angered it so soon?</p><br /><br />    <p>To Google I went, and then to Apple&#8217;s support forums.  Lo and behold, hundreds of other MacBook owners being whined at by their expensive new purchases.  Apple&#8217;s official stance?  Denial.</p><br /><br />    <p>This is not the sort of thing I take lightly.</p><br /><br />    <p>I&#8217;ve started a <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/whinefix/petition.html">petition</a> to fix the MacBook Pro whine flaw.  If you or someone you know is tired of being whined at, take a stand and sign the petition.</p>
