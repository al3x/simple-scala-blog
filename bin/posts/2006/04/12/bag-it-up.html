<h1>Bag It Up</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ve used courier/messenger bags of one sort or another since I was 13 for just about everything: schoolbooks, weekend trips, laptops, records.  Like many, I&#8217;m passionate about my choice of bag.  After all, a bag is an ever-present companion, at once an expression of personal style and one&#8217;s approach to utility.</p><br /><br />    <p>I&#8217;ve never had aires about my explicit use of messenger bags.  I have no courier aspirations.  Hell, I haven&#8217;t even owned a bicycle in ages.  No, I always went with messenger bags because of their maneuverability on public transit.  A backpack is liable to crowd other passengers, but a good courier bag will hug your body.  Spend a few months wearing one day-in and day-out and you&#8217;ll find that you can reach most everything in the bag sight unseen, even in tight situations.</p><br /><br />    <p>But what good is all that if you&#8217;re constantly in a car?  When I bought the MacBook, suddenly the heavy buckle on my <a href="http://www.chromebags.com/">Chrome</a> began to look more like a potential cracked screen than a handy feature.  Moreover, it&#8217;s hard to find a laptop sleeve with enough padding to give me peace of mind while it rattles around in a courier bag.</p><br /><br />    <p>So, for the first time in nearly a decade, I bought a different kind of bag.  This <a href="http://www.burton.com/gear/products.asp?productID=1089&#38;shortMaterialNumber=B7W08301">Burton DJ bag</a> doesn&#8217;t have the svelte appeal of a courier bag; indeed it looks more like luggage, as a friend remarked.  It certainly doesn&#8217;t distribute weight as comfortably across the shoulders, padded strap or no.  But, for the price, it&#8217;s got an amazing number of purpose-specific pockets and compartments that fit the multitude of gear I carry to the coffee shop, hackathons, and (soon) to DJing out.</p><br /><br />    <p>I&#8217;d heartily recommend Burton&#8217;s DJ bag to other laptop musicians, or at least nerds with a bulky pair of headphones who can&#8217;t stand anything rattling about freely in their bag.  Avoid the other materials its available in, though, or risk hefty fines from the Department of Sartorial Reparations.  Honestly: faux crocodile, Burton?</p>
