<h1>Two Nerdy Things</h1>
<ol><br />    <li>By yesterday I&#8217;d purged enough Rails propaganda from my bloodstream to browse <a href="http://project.ioni.st/">Projectionist</a> again without wincing.  Several pages back in their archives is mention of <a href="http://www.iolanguage.com/">Io</a>, which I know I&#8217;d seen a couple months back but never really looked at.  Holy cats but that is a sweet-ass programming language.  It would be awesome if the latest release would build without dying on an illegal instruction.</li><br />    </ol><br /><br />    <ol><br />    <li>This morning I saw that there&#8217;s <a href="http://mail.opensolaris.org/pipermail/zfs-discuss/2006-April/002121.html">talk</a> of porting <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/ds/zfs.jsp"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">ZFS</span></span></a> to Mac <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span>.  How cool would that be?  Get yourself a couple Xserve RAIDs and be all ZFSy all over them?  I&#8217;m totally with the people on the subsequent mailing list posts who wish Apple would just buy Sun.  More reliable Apple server gear would be swell.  I&#8217;d run Io on it.</li><br />    </ol><br /><br />    <p>That is all.</p>
