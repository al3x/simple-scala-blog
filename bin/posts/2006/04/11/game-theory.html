<h1>Game Theory</h1>
<p>Every few years my computer hardware purchases line up with the ever-increasing requirements of PC games.  My new MacBook Pro, as it turns out, has more than enough juice to run the latest and greatest in 3D distractions.  I couldn&#8217;t think of a better reason to try  <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/">Boot Camp</a>, so several days ago I loaded up Windows <span class="caps"><span class="caps">XP SP2</span></span> and dove into a few recent games.</p><br /><br />    <p>It turns out that there&#8217;s a reason I haven&#8217;t been a regular (that is, daily or bi-daily) gamer since I was about 11: games kinda bore me.  Or, if they don&#8217;t actively bore me, I feel like my time has been frittered away after the fact.</p><br /><br />    <p>The godly power bestowed on me in <em>Black &#38; White 2</em> couldn&#8217;t keep me engaged.  Navigating derilict buildings and getting in fistfights with psychotic junkies in <em>Condemned</em> was only fun for a few minutes.  The hair-raising tenor of <em>F.E.A.R.</em> couldn&#8217;t get me over the fact that I was walking through level after <em>Doom</em>-derivitave level, blowing away identical soldiers like it was 1993.</p><br /><br />    <p>For all the production value and cinematics of the games I tried the experience just couldn&#8217;t captivate me.  When I&#8217;ve really enjoyed gaming in the last few years it&#8217;s been as a social activity: <em>Soul Caliber 2</em> tournaments in the dorm room or playing through all of <em>Halo 2</em> in cooperative mode with a friend.  Yes, buddies tried to get me into MMORPGs like <em>World of Warcraft</em>, but &#8220;virtually social&#8221; just isn&#8217;t the same as social-social.  PCs don&#8217;t seem terribly conducive to the type of gaming I enjoy.</p><br /><br />    <p>Though a game console is a typical bachelor purchase, in my case it&#8217;s an investment I wouldn&#8217;t bother making unless I had a significant other who&#8217;d enjoy an evening in conquering virtual enemies in two-player mode.  Gaming, for me, is all about shared experience and healthy competition.</p><br /><br />    <p>Needless to say, I wiped Windows XP off my MacBook.  Boot Camp worked flawlessly both coming and going.  Henceforth, my multi-OS needs will be met by <a href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels Workstation</a> while I wait for a Mac version of <a href="http://www.vmware.com">VMware</a>.  Not that I frequently find myself in need of Windows.  Ugh.</p><br /><br />    <p>I intend to put my reclaimed free time and hard drive space to better, <a href="http://www.seriousdjs.net">DJ-related</a> uses.</p>
