<h1>Silenced!</h1>
<p>Yesterday I posted a thread about the aforementioned <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/whinefix/petition.html">petition</a> on Apple&#8217;s MacBook Pro support forum.  This morning I went back to check on the discussion and it was gone.  Unbelievable.</p><br /><br />    <p><span class="caps"><span class="caps">TUAW</span></span> has some <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2006/04/02/does-the-macbook-pro-fan-constantly-run-and-a-note-about-the-wh/">interesting info</a> if you&#8217;re following the MacBook issue(s), and <a href="http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=1584">Daily Tech</a> suggests that revised models are shipping, although no word on whether the whine is amongst the fixes.</p>
