<p>The best girl trouble album in the world is, and has been, and will be: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00004TXXC?v=glance">Mad For Sadness</a> by <a href="http://www.arabstrap.co.uk/">Arab Strap</a>, and that&#8217;s all there is to it.</p><br /><br />    <p>I think my perspective on male-female relationships is lying somewhere in the media valley between <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098635/">When Harry Met Sally</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000019GE?v=glance">Songs About Fucking</a>.</p><br /><br />    <p>Reasonably sure this is not healthy.</p>
