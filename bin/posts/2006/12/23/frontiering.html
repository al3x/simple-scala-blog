<p><a href="http://www.synergizement.com">Timoni</a> and I will be in the midwest as of this evening, visiting her family for the holidays.  We return on December 29th.</p><br /><br />    <p>I&#8217;ve been told that everything from the landscapes to the people are depressing.  It will be bitterly cold.  But, on the upside, our week is essentially composed of driving from one holiday meal to the next.  I am not concerned.</p><br /><br />    <p>Flying, then, to the flyover states.</p>
