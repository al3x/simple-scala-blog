<h1>In Case You Need My Code Scraps</h1>
<p>Since rejiggering my domain recently, I’d been running <a href="http://code.al3x.net/">code.al3x.net</a> on <a href="http://collaboa.org/">Collaboa</a>, a Rails-based <a href="http://trac.edgewall.com/">Trac</a> clone.  However, the Collaboa project doesn’t seem to be going anywhere fast, despite an announcement of renewed activity.  In response, a frustrated Collaboa user announced a fork called <a href="http://www.retrospectiva.org/">Retrospectiva</a>, which I switched to a couple days ago.</p><br /><br />  <p>Retrospectiva is quite full-featured for a beta release.  It already goes a ways beyond Collaboa, and even Trac in some respects (the blog extension, for example).  Retrospectiva isn’t production-ready, though, so for the time being code.al3x.net is simply serving up plain ol’ Apache-powered Subversion.</p><br /><br />  <p>I’m so taken with Nginx that I decided to keep it as my public-facing <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTTP</span></span> server.  I just run an Apache virtual host for Subversion on a high port and and tell Nginx to proxy to it like so:</p><br /><br />  <p><tt><pre><br />server {<br />      listen 80;<br />      server_name code.al3x.net;<br /><br />      location / {<br />        rewrite ^/ /svn/  permanent;<br />      }<br /><br />      location /svn/ {<br />          proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8010;<br />      }<br />}<br /></pre></tt></p><br /><br />  <p>The rewrite bounce on <tt>/</tt> is thanks to httpd stupidness: you can’t serve up a repository index – that plain “Collection of repositories” page you’ve probably seen around – from <tt>Location /</tt> as best I can tell.  Various attempts to <tt>Alias</tt> or <tt>Redirect</tt> in my Apache configuration didn’t prove fruitful, but Nginx works like a champ.</p><br /><br />  <p>At some point I’ll move back to Retrospectiva or Trac or the like, but there’s simply not enough code there right now to worry about it.</p>
