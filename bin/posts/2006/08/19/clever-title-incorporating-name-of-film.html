<h1>Clever Title Incorporating Name Of Film in Question</h1>
<p>I would like to make one thing clear to those of you who may be wondering about <em>Snakes On A Plane</em>: it is a gore flick first and a campy action movie a distant, distant second.</p><br /><br />    <p>In expecting a campy action movie I was expecting scene after scene of contrived tension carried to absurd ends.  What I saw last night was some writer&#8217;s list of horrible ways to die, most but not all of them snake-related.  The deaths are mostly governed by standard horror film ethics: anyone having sex, doing drugs, or being unpleasant in a stereotypical way is doomed to a gruesome fate.</p><br /><br />    <p>When an anonymous plane denizen is trampled and dies of a high heel embedded in his ear, it&#8217;s time to leave.  I didn&#8217;t enjoy such unnecessary brutality in <em>Saw II</em> or <em>Hostel</em>, and no amount of  internet meme frenzy could convince me that <em>Snakes</em> was worth sitting through.</p>
