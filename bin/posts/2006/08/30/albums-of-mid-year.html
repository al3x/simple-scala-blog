<h1>Albums Of The Mid-Year</h1>
<p>More than halfway through 2006 there are only two records I think I&#8217;ll still adore in a few more months:</p><br /><br />    <ol><br />    <li><a href="http://www.google.com/musicl?lid=YDfjhEUstrF&#38;aid=mn9Q-AZu_8G">He Poos Clouds</a> by <a href="http://finalfantasyeternal.com/">Final Fantasy</a> and </li><br />        <li>Burial&#8217;s <a href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/36986/Burial_Burial">self-titled full length</a>.</li><br />    </ol><br /><br />    <p>Clearly I need to scrounge more music.  I&#8217;m getting to that point when looking through my library is like a grocery aisle full of unappetizing canned foods.</p>
