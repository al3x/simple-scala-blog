<h1>London.call()-ing</h1>
<p><img src="/images/6.png" align="right" /></p><br /><br />    <p>The full speaker list isn&#8217;t yet online, but I found out over the weekend that I&#8217;ll be speaking at <a href="http://europe.railsconf.org/" rel="tag">RailsConf Europe</a> in London this September.  I didn&#8217;t get a chance to attend RailsConf in Chicago a couple months back so this will be my first time face-to-face with a multitude of other Rails heads.</p><br /><br />    <p>My talk is entitled &#8220;Securing Rails: A Whole-Stack Approach&#8221;.  As you might guess, I aim to cover the multitude of security concerns that developers face when deploying a production web application.  Some of the material will be Rails-specific and some of it is general-purpose knowledge.  Security can be a dry topic, but I hope to make the talk fun, fast, and information-packed.</p><br /><br />    <p><a href="http://www.synergizement.com/">Timoni</a> will be coming along with me to London and spending the Thursday and Friday that I&#8217;ll be in the conference sight-seeing.  We&#8217;re hoping to stay for a good week but finding cheap accommodations is a bit of a challenge.  We&#8217;re not crazy about hotels so we&#8217;re considering trying to rent a tiny flat for the week or some other alternative.</p><br /><br />    <p>If you have suggestions about anything London-related, speak up.  Favorite lodging, restaurants, sights?  Drop a comment.</p>
