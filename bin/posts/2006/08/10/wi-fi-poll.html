<h1>A Wi-Fi Poll</h1>
<p>If you have a wi-fi router at home do you run it open or closed?  If closed, do you use <span class="caps"><span class="caps">WEP</span></span>/WPA or <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MAC</span></span> filtering or what?  What&#8217;s your logic either way?  Leave a comment if you please.</p><br /><br />    <p>I&#8217;m curious to see how people are using home wireless networks several years on.  I just opened up my router after a year or so of running it closed for no particular reason.  Feel free to surf if you find yourself in Clarendon; the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SSID</span></span> is <tt>nice_packets_lol</tt>.</p>
