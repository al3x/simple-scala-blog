<h1>EC2: Really Pay-Per-Use?</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s been literally <em>hours</em> and I haven&#8217;t received that <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> beta invite.  In that time the idea has been marinating, and I&#8217;m left with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.</p><br /><br />    <p>Some folks <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/ec2">talking about <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EC2</span></span></a> seem to think that you pay per <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPU</span></span> time.  They probably think that because it <em>makes sense</em>.  Unfortunately, the reality of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EC2</span></span> that you pay per hour of uptime.  That makes some scenarios impractical.</p><br /><br />    <p>Example: say you just want to host your blog on Amazon&#8217;s cloud.  You load up a VM with MySQL, Rails, maybe a couple Mongrels running behind Apache.  You can now push serious bandwidth at an affordable price thanks to the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3">S3</a> storage backend.  But what about that couple of hours per day when your site just doesn&#8217;t get any hits?  Why are you paying the same for those hours as the hours when you do several thousand visitors?  Are idling web and database servers really that taxing?</p><br /><br />    <p>The answer, I think, is that Amazon is purposefully trying to avoid the small-time hosting/reseller market by charging for uptime and not <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPU</span></span> time.  If small users actually paid for what they use on <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EC2</span></span> it&#8217;d cost next to nothing, even in aggregate.  On the other hand, if a big web application uses <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EC2</span></span> to fire up a bunch of VMs on demand to cope with increased traffic, Amazon makes good money even if those VMs are only up for eight hours a day.</p><br /><br />    <p>I don&#8217;t really blame Amazon for setting up <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EC2</span></span> this way, but it&#8217;s kind of a bummer.  The idea of a truly pay-per-use VM off in a cloud somewhere is really appealing for personal projects.  I&#8217;ve seen inexpensive (around <span class="caps"><span class="caps">USD</span></span>$20/month) <span class="caps"><span class="caps">VPS</span></span> hosting plans, but none that are downright cheap, and certainly none as flexible as <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EC2</span></span>.</p>
