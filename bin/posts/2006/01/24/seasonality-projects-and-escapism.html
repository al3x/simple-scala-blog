<h1>Seasonality, Projects, and Escapism</h1>
<p>I&#8217;d like to offer a word of advice to any readers who deal with with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">SAD</span></span></a>: remember your <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/L/Last_Known_Good_configuration.html">known good state</a>.</p><br /><br />    <p>When you&#8217;re seasonal, you can find your life suddenly unrecognizable.  When the dark months come, the ideas, routines, duties, and people you care about will seem distant and unappealing.  You become a different person, but it&#8217;s nearly impossible to see the change from your low, gloomy purview.</p><br /><br />    <p>It affects me the same way, year after year: I start looking around for new projects that will take me away from the familiar; I consider moving and uprooting my life as a distraction from the depression; I blame the people around me when they try to point out these changes rather than heeding their concerns.  Every year gets a little easier, though.  Every year I manage to listen less to the voices that want me to make foolish changes, deflecting them with a mantra composed of the qualities of the person I am when I&#8217;m not under the winter&#8217;s cloud.  I remember my known-good state.</p><br /><br />    <p>The person I am under sunshine is committed to his friends and family, happy living in DC, proud of his job, engaged by the information security field, and so forth.  A combination of factors, not least of which is the absurdly mild winter we&#8217;ve had here, has burnt off the cloud cover, particularly in the last few days.  As ever, it&#8217;s a relief, and this time around the fallout is minor.</p><br /><br />    <p>I started several projects while moody and looking around for distractions.  Two of them I&#8217;m still excited about (one well predates the winter blues).  I&#8217;ll be announcing them here soon.  The other two I could use your thoughts on whether to go forward with.</p><br /><br />    <h4>Questionable Project #1: a weblog about digital DJing.</h4><br /><br />    <p>The design and static content for this is all done.  This seemed like a good idea at the time, but is probably too time-consuming to do well, and possibly unnecessary given the respectable coverage of the topic that <a href="http://www.skratchworx.com/">Scratchworx</a> offers.  I enjoy writing about the subject, but maybe my time would be better spent behind the decks than at the keyboard?</p><br /><br />    <h4>Questionable Project #2: a registry for people who want to fall in love.</h4><br /><br />    <p>No, not quite a dating site.  The idea is this: there are dating sites for every sexual orientation, age bracket, ethnic group, religious affiliation, hobby, lifestyle, fetish, and hair color under the sun.  Most of these sites pander to short-term dating, or allow for a range from friends/activity partners to long-term with the sleazy outlier of &#8220;play&#8221; or &#8220;hookups&#8221;.  There is not, to the best of my knowledge, a website exclusively for people who want to fall in love.  eHarmony comes close, but is creepy.</p><br /><br />    <p>My site would be free of the gimmicks of most dating sites &#8211; blogs, social networking, quizzes &#8211; and free in cost.  Members could provide salient details about themselves in a freeform fashion, not suffering the tedious and restrictive profile questions most sites offer.  Members would provide their preferred method of contact, eschewing the awkward in-site messaging systems most dating sites employ.  It would be simple, humane, and encouraging for the romantics out there.  Maybe you&#8217;d even put the lil&#8217; badge for the site on your blog: &#8220;I want to fall in love&#8221;.  Aww.</p><br /><br />    <p>It&#8217;s easy to have a warm fuzzy feeling about this project, and the upfront development time isn&#8217;t that long.  Everyone I&#8217;ve talked to about it likes the idea.  If it got popular, however, maintenance could quickly become a full-time job.  On a selfish personal level, it&#8217;s also more time spent coding when I could be out meeting people the normal way; that is, it might be a solution, but it&#8217;s more likely to exacerbate the problem.</p><br /><br />    <p>So now you know a couple of the sort of things a lovelorn geek and bedroom DJ comes up with in the grips of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SAD</span></span>, along with fancies of going back to freelance web app development and moving to Portland or Vancouver or someplace soft, airily lefty, and forgiving.  Jekyll and Hyde, innit?</p><br /><br />    <p>Your thoughts are welcome and encouraged.</p>
