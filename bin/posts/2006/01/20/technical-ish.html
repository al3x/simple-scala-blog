<h1>Technical Ish</h1>
<p>Email sent to my usual address seems to be bouncing.</p><br /><br />    <p>I&#8217;ve been forwarding that address to a Gmail account for months now, but sometime last night Google decided that wasn&#8217;t cool, and is sending back nasty little <strong><span class="caps"><span class="caps">PERM</span></span>_FAILURE: <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SMTP</span></span> Error (state 9): 554  Relay access denied</strong> messages to any poor soul that tries to email me.</p><br /><br />    <p>Except that spam is still getting through.  Just not, y&#8217;know, emails I want.  Thanks, Google.</p><br /><br />    <p>I&#8217;ve emailed Gmail support about it but I don&#8217;t expect any resolution, ever.</p><br /><br />    <p><em><span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPDATE</span></span>:</em> seems to have resolved itself.  Weirdness.</p>
