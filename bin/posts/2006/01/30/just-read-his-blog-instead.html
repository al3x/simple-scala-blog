<h1>Just Read His Blog Instead</h1>
<p>Another one of my ill-fated projects was starting a blog about thought and critical theory with <a href="http://millionairesocialite.com/">Phil</a>.  But he just moved to New York City, I&#8217;m really busy again, and the subject matter really doesn&#8217;t warrant the waste of bandwidth.</p><br /><br />    <p>Just read his blog, which is principally about fashion and the economics and sociology thereof.  It&#8217;s neat, even if you&#8217;re not into fashion.  There are graphs.</p><br /><br />    <p>Big luck in the Big Apple bwoy.</p>
