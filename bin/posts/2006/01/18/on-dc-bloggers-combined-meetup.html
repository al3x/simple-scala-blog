<h1>On The DC Bloggers Combined Meetup</h1>
<p>There have been two factions of DC-area bloggers meeting up every month: the proper Meetup that I&#8217;ve attended and a self-organized happy hour.  This evening the two events merged, and our more reserved Meetup crowd was injected with the vitality that only a bunch of happy hour veterans can contribute.</p><br /><br />    <p>I&#8217;ve lost count &#8211; and the URLs &#8211; of all the people I met; everyone was in fine spirits.  The one consistency of note: ask a given blogger what they blog bout and you&#8217;re more than likely to get a self-depricating response to the effect that they write about a little bit of everything but mostly personal stuff.  Many bloggers I talked to haven&#8217;t at it long, but even in this age of topic-specific &#8220;professional&#8221; weblogs, few are choosing to limit themselves to just one subject.  There&#8217;s a diarist in us all, it seems.</p><br /><br />    <p>If you&#8217;re a Meetup attendee who managed to remember my site the next morning, please leave a comment so I can try to put sites with faces.  Maybe I&#8217;ll see some of you at the <a href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2006/01/10/first_big_party_of_new_year_to_be_debauched_fun.php">DCist happy hour</a>, if I can work up the social resolve to spend another evening in a smoky, sardine-packed DC bar.</p>
