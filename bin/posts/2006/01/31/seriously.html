<h1>Seriously</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s time to unveil this project I&#8217;ve been going on about.</p><br /><br />    <p>Take a gander at <a href="http://www.seriousdjs.net/">Serious DJs</a>.  Go on.  Take a quick look and then head back here.</p><br /><br />    <p>You&#8217;re back?  Cool.  Now, the story.</p><br /><br />    <p>A few months ago I was having some beers with <a href="http://www.5dots.net/">Craig</a> at the <a href="http://thebrickskeller.com/">Brickskeller</a> and we were, as usual, bullshitting about music.  To say that Craig and I are music buddies is an understatement.  Our iTunes libraries look 75% alike, I&#8217;d say.  We each make sure the other has heard the best new albums, new radio jams, and new mixes.  We can talk about music for hours, and frequently do.</p><br /><br />    <p>Now, Craig also makes music.  He&#8217;d played around a bit with DJing but had never gotten way into it.  I&#8217;d been missing it.  So I say: &#8220;why don&#8217;t we work on DJing together?&#8221;</p><br /><br />    <p>So we did.  And are.</p><br /><br />    <p>Craig brought me up to speed with new features in <a href="http://www.ableton.com/">Ableton Live</a>.  We started working through track lists, choosing a theme and meticulously piecing songs together.  The first couple mixes took the better part of a day, each.  The most recent one went faster, as we&#8217;ve fallen into a work routine.</p><br /><br />    <p>Right now we&#8217;ve got a jungle mix, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dj_Screw">Screw</a> mix, and a discoish mix on <a href="http://www.seriousdjs.net/">the site</a>, all free for the taking.  If you like what you hear, please spread the word: link the site, tag it on <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>, share the MP3s, or just play them for a friend.</p><br /><br />    <p>We hope you have as much fun listening to these and future mixes and we have making them.</p>
