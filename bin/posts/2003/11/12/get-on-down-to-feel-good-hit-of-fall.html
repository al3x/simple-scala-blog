<h1>Get On Down To The Feel Good Hit of The Fall (!!!)</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I&#8217;m way into <a href="http://brainwashed.com/!!<img src="/">&#8221; alt=&#8221;&#8221; /&gt;!!</a>.  You should be, too; it&#8217;s hard not to be into something so unbearably funky.  Point me to more of this &#8220;dance-punk,&#8221; my minions!<br /><br /><br /><br />I never said anything the other day about not dancing alone at <em>rock</em> shows.  Which is good, &#8216;cause I&#8217;d boogie the fuck down to this, alone or otherwise.  They need to get to DC soon.  And I need their other albums (the self-titled <em>&#8221;!!!&#8221;</em> is what&#8217;s presently licking my eardrums so so good).</p><br />
