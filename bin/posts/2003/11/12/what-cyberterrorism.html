<h1>What Cyberterrorism?</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Gartner <a href="http://rss.com.com/2100-7355_3-5105732.html">is all like</a>, &#8220;uh, there totally hasn&#8217;t ever been a known incident of cyberterrorism.  Like ever.  Dude.  Never.&#8221;  And folks looking to pad their budgets are like, &#8220;but dude dude dude they could totally 0wnz0r us like tomorrow!&#8221;  And Gartner is like, &#8220;dude, seriously.  I mean, c&#8217;mon.&#8221; <br /><br /><br /><br />What do I think?  Cyberterrorism is a definite buzzword and should be approached with extreme skepticism.  That said, it&#8217;s always better to be paranoid than, you know, dead.  There&#8217;s a middle ground, and you sure won&#8217;t find it in Symantec&#8217;s pitches to Homeland Security.  Grain of salt, move along.</p><br />
