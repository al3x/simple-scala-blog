<h1>Content I&#8217;ll Glady Pay For and, Disturbingly Related, Guns</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Definitely just picked up a month <a href="http://www.suicidegirls.com/">Suicide Girls</a> membership.  And damned but if I still don&#8217;t have <em>such</em> a weakness for punk/goth/quirky-lookin&#8217; girls.  Between that and the gun fetish apparently lying dormant in me awakened by the image of Trinity with a <a href="http://madogre.com/Interviews/Guns_of_the_Matrix.htm">firearm</a> to the Merovingian&#8217;s head in <em>The Matrix Revolutions</em> last Wednesday I&#8217;d say my kinks are just asking for trouble.  Punk girls with guns?  If <em>Tank Girl</em> taught me anything, that&#8217;s bad news.  Shit gets blowed up [sic].<br /><br /><br /><br />(And yes, I can hear the shudders, winces, and pleas of my regular readers to never, ever, ever again explore my sexuality in blog form ever again, at all, ever.  Sorry.)</p><br />
