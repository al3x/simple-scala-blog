<h1>Things I Learned Friday Night in Da Club</h1>
--- <br />- |<br />  <ol><br /><li><a href="http://www.deephousenetwork.com/">Deep House</a> is way, way more entertaining than glitch/clicks-n-cuts/tech-house/whatever you wanna call that smarmy self-important Euro shit.<br /><li>Said smarmy clicks shit hasn&#8217;t gone anywhere new in a solid couple years.  Artists working in the style aren&#8217;t having enough fun with it, <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Akufen">Akufen</a>-style, mixing in old soul and disco and such.  Instead, they&#8217;re mixing all the faux-seriousness of <a href="http://www.trendcentral.com/trends/trendarticle.asp?tcArticleId=200">electroclash</a> for a mechanical, awkward (even for a techo subgenre) sound that most folks couldn&#8217;t dance to for more than 30 seconds at a time.  And I&#8217;m not the only cat in the DC &#8220;experimental electronic music&#8221; scene who&#8217;s getting tired of it: <a href="http://www.3particles.com/">Richard</a> was feelin&#8217; the deep house too.  Dance music should be fun.<br /><li>I can&#8217;t dance alone anymore.  The last time I did and had fun was back in my raver days, and I&#8217;ll let you infer why an activity that would otherwise be kind of sad was acceptable in those circumstances.  But now I can&#8217;t happily dance alone, and I don&#8217;t have any close female just-friends I could go dancing with for the purposes of groove-thang getting-on.  Note to self: future relationship prospects music enjoy dancing.<br /><li>There is, apparently, a whole world of &#8220;nu soul&#8221; remixes of Top 40 rap/R&#38;B out there.  Like, enough that one of the DJs spun almost exclusively such things for his entire set.  Bizarre.<br /><li>Related to the not enjoying dancing alone: I&#8217;m don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to bother with dance nights, even &#8220;experimental&#8221; dance nights, until I&#8217;ve found a femme.  You can&#8217;t really meet people at them: it&#8217;s loud, folks come as couples or groups or come to dance alone (<em><strong>cough</strong>ondrugs<strong>cough</strong></em>), and I end up leaving feeling alone, smelling of smoke, and out about $7 for the door and another $5 for a sugar free Red Bull plus tip.  That&#8217;s a lot for smokiness and loneliness.  And a Red Bull.<br /><li>Big black women from Baltimore have way more fun in clubs than pretty much anyone.<br /></ol><br /><br /><br />- <p>I think that&#8217;s everything.</p><br />
