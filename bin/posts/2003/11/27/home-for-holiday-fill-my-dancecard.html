<h1>Home For the Holiday: Fill My Dancecard</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I&#8217;m back in Bethesda through Sunday.  If you&#8217;re a friend or well-wisher with an interest in the experience of &#8220;hanging out&#8221; with me, but are normally turned off of the prospect by the crime, stench, and distant location of Baltimore, this is a golden opportunity you&#8217;d be well advised not to pass up.  Friday and Saturday are looking good, though <a href="http://musicismyreligion.blogspot.com/">A-to-the-zee-eye-zeez</a> is guaranteed a slice sometime Saturday.  But still, there are literally <em>hours</em> of my time on the table here.  Don&#8217;t let this chance pass you by.<br /><br /><br /><br />Hit me up.  Holla at&#8217;cha boy.  Et cetera.</p><br />
