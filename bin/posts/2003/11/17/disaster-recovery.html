<h1>Disaster, Recovery</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>My iBook was stepped on and sustained the sole injury of a damaged hard drive.  The machine  decided it no longer had a hard drive: no diagnostic software even reported the existence of anything other than the <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">DVD</span></span></span>/CD-RW combo drive on the <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">IDE</span></span></span> chain.  The best explanation for this &#8220;forgotten hard drive&#8221; was a broken controller chip on the drive itself.<br /><br /><br /><br />I replaced the drive in the iBook myself, swapping in another 40 gigger.  Replacing a hard drive in an iBook is a hideous, miserable exercise in screws, plates, brackets, some more screws, tabs, screws, and then some screws.  So many screws.  But it&#8217;s done, and I&#8217;m writing this from a clean install of Panther, for better and, well, worse.<br /><br /><br /><br />As I mentioned before, I don&#8217;t have many physical possessions.  I do, however, have quite a lot of data.  My last backup of my home directory, excepting the 22-odd GBs of music, was roughly a month ago.  My mail is kept remotely via <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">IMAP</span></span></span>, thankfully.  But I need that hard drive working again long enough get my music and a few other sundry files off of it.<br/><br /><br /><br /><br />Any suggestions or experiences with data recovery services?<br /><br /><br /><br />What a crappy weekend.</p>"<br />
