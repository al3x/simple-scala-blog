<h1>I&#8217;m Never Spinning Anything Else</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I proclaim the dancefloor stormer of the winter season to be <em>not</em> &#8220;The Illness,&#8221; the proclaimed single off <a href="http://www.brainwashed.com/kid606/">Kid606</a>&#8217;s latest <em>Kill Sound Before Sound Kills You</em>, but rather single B-side &#8220;Ecstasy Motherfucker.&#8221;  The majority of the new album is the sort of crazed jungle-cum-gabber that the Kid treated us to on his last tour through Baltimore and this track is no exception.  Dominated by a fierce, schizophrenic beat, knowingly hackneyed samples (a voice at the end proclaims, &#8220;I <strong>am</strong> a cliche), and 303 acid-style tweakings somehow made new and fun, it&#8217;s hard for any electronic music fan not to find something to smile about whilst shaking their head/ass/groove thang.  I am elated that I&#8217;ve got a copy of this beast on vinyl.  You suckas are never hearing anything else.</p><br />
