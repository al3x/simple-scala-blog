<h1>Where Should I Go?</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I am thinking seriously of leaving my school, <a href="http://www.umbc.edu/"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">UMBC</span></span></span></a>.  I need to leave this place between Baltimore and Nowhere, MD.  I need to leave this place where nobody makes friends outside their student organizations and their fraternities-without-frat-houses, where they eat lunch in groups and commute home alone in the evening, the campus grounds left starving for presence and activity.  I can sit out at night by the beautiful man-made pond where the geese swim when it&#8217;s warm and nobody walks by for hour stretches.  It&#8217;s not that it&#8217;s a bad place, or that I cannot learn what I need to learn here.  It&#8217;s that if I&#8217;m going to do this college thing, where they tell me I&#8217;m to expand my horizons and meet people and acculturate, I should do it some place with culture and people and horizon expansion mechanisms.  I&#8217;m a depressive geek who&#8217;s never had a big circle of friends and even <em>I&#8217;m</em> having trouble at this smallish, technical, trying-not-be-a-commuter campus; it&#8217;s much worse for more the extroverted Scott, the one good friend I&#8217;ve made here, who also has a mind to leave.  It&#8217;s an odd campus.<br /><br /><br /><br />I aim to study Information Technology Policy.  That means a prospective school needs to have a passible Computer Science/Information Systems program and a quite respectable Political Science/Public Policy program.  It would help if there were resources in Information Security.  My grades are okay, but my resume is better.  I&#8217;d go pretty much anywhere in the country.  Or elsewhere.<br /><br /><br /><br />Where should I go?</p><br />
