--- <br />- "<p>Look at the Fedora Core 1 (the community-developed version of what was once RedHat Linux before they decided consumer OSs don&#8217;t make money) <a href=\"http://fedora.redhat.com/docs/release-notes/\">release notes</a>.  Scroll down to the section about fonts, namely the process for installing a font.  Read.  Read it again.
