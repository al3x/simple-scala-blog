<h1>Krav Maga?</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I&#8217;ve been eager to take up a martial art for some time, and the Israeli military hand-to-hand combat form Krav Maga came with high recommendation.  <a href="http://kravmagadc.com/">Krav Maga DC</a> has an open house tomorrow (er, later today) and I&#8217;m gonna check it out with <a href="http://www.timeporn.net/">Phil</a>, who can&#8217;t be bothered to update his blog because he&#8217;s recently been made God&#8217;s personal IT subcontractor but totally lied about being able to build a relational soul-management database with a .NET front-end in 24.5 seconds and is now paying for it mightily.  No shit.<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#8217;ll tell you how the Krav Maga intro went, you lucky dog.  Hope you and yours are having a good extended Thanksgiving weekend.  Or, if you&#8217;re extra-US, hope you&#8217;re enjoying not living under a regime of utterly mind-boggling stupidity.  Oh wait.  Fuck.  Just have a good weekend.</p><br />
