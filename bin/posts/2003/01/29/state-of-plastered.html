<h1>State of the Plastered</h1>
--- <br />- <p>If I had been playing the <a href="http://www.marcmelzer.net/sotudg/">State of the Union Drinking Game</a>, I&#8217;d be quite drunk right now.  But there&#8217;s just not enough alcohol in the tri-state area, and I&#8217;ve got classes .. all the rest of the week.  Because the hangover would take that long to clear up.  I think you get the idea.  Bush, and our cowardly Democratic &#8220;opposition,&#8221; are infuriating.</p><br />
