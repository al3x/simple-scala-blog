<h1>Rockage</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Those who know me know that I no longer &#8220;rock.&#8221;  I gave up rock music years ago, dismayed with the seemingly unending repetition coming from 99% of the bands who aspired to rock.  Most things with guitars generally deter me, and almost all things emo/indie/post-rock make me gag.  But, rather belatedly, I&#8217;ve come upon several exceptions to this rule: <a href=\"http://www.spiritualized.com/\">Spiritualized</a>, <a href=\"http://www.flaminglips.com/main.php\">The Flaming Lips</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.neutralmilkhotel.net/\">Neutral Milk Hotel</a>.  Now, for most people, these bands are not average rock music.  But I guess that gives you some sense of just how disconnected from that sound I&#8217;ve become.  All have guitars, employ a verse-chorus-verse songwriting style for most of their numbers, and write songs about rock sorts of things, like love, sex, and death.   Of these bands, I can&#8217;t get enough of the following songs: <a href=\"http://www.no-fi.com/spiritualized/ladiesgents_lyrics.html\">&#8220;Cool Waves&#8221;</a> by Spiritualized, <a href=\"http://neutralmilkhotel.net/holland.html\">&#8220;Holland, 1945&#8221;</a> by Neutral Milk Hotel, and <a href=\"http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/SongUnid/B3CC1C6529F1C4C148256C14001E1479\">&#8220;Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell&#8221;</a> by The Flaming Lips.</p>"<br />
