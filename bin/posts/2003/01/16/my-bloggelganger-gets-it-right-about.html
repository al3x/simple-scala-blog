<h1>My Bloggelganger Gets it Right About Avril &#8220;Media Creation&#8221;
Levine</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Wozz is sick of hearing about Avril Lavine&#8217;s street cred.  So am I.  But he<br /><a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0001019/2003/01/14.html#a433">blogged</a> on<br />it, and makes the point that &#8220;her&#8221; songwriting is a product of the same team<br />that vomited up the Backstreet Boys&#8217; material.  Performance-oriented music<br />is generally about posturing, and that&#8217;s fine.  But don&#8217;t confuse a record industry<br />product with independent artists.  Oh, and ladies?  Don&#8217;t embarass yourselves by<br />identifying with a sham singer totally designed to get you to identify with her<br />&#8220;girl power&#8221; bratty feminism.  Her single was called &#8220;skater boi,&#8221; for fucksakes.</p><br />
