<h1>New Blosxom, Now With Real Version Numbers!</h1>
--- <br />- <p>So, just as the guy from <a href="http://www.sundot.com">Sundot</a> and I<br />were lamenting a few long-standing Blosxom bugs, Rael goes and &lt;a<br />href=&#8221;http://www.raelity.org/archives/2003/01/23#blosxom_1_0&#8221;&gt;releases<br />Blosxom 1.0</a> (the first version not to use all sorts of wacky &#8221;+&#8221;s and<br />&#8220;i&#8221;s).  1.0 seems to fix this stuff, though it had a bug of its own that<br />Rael quickly advised me on via the comments/TrackBack system he just put<br />together for his own blog.  Personally, I&#8217;m dying to try out the comments<br />feature and explore the plug-in architecture that&#8217;s been in the works for<br />a number of weeks.  But cheers to Rael and those who helped with bug fixes<br />for making Blosxom the most flexible and unique blogging system around!</p><br />
