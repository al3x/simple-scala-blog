<h1>Pretty Pleased</h1>
--- <br />- <p>So, I&#8217;ve settled on a layout I like.  At least one regular reader reports both no rendering problems in Mac IE and agreement that the layout is readable.  I moved away from Waferbaby&#8217;s <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CSS</span></span></span></span>-only layout, as <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CSS</span></span></span></span> is still piss-poor at doing multiple column layouts without lots of kludges and hacks, and even then the results are rarely consistent across browsers and platforms.  But I know this layout renders acceptably in Chimera, Safari and, now, Mac IE.  I&#8217;ll flesh out the remaining pages of the new layout with content over the weekend.  Thanks for bearing with me.</p><br />
