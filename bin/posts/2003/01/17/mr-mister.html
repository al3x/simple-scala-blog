<h1>Mr. Mister</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Listening to <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CSPAN</span></span></span></span> radio, as I am often wont to do, I flinched at Whitehouse press<br />monkey Ari Flischer calling a reporter &#8220;Elizabeth.&#8221; Not<br />&#8220;Mrs. x&#8221; or &#8220;Ms Y.&#8221;  The trend of public informality in politics has gone on far too long.<br />Just once, when some smarmy Southern sonofabitch says to his debate opponent<br />&#8220;call me Jim,&#8221; I want the other guy to say &#8220;and <i>you</i> can call me Mr. Suchandsuch.&#8221; <br />Politics isn&#8217;t about backslapping friends and informality; or rather, it totally<br />is, but the public shouldn&#8217;t know about it.  Why are we on a firstname basis with<br />those who should be figures of authority and public confidence, lingustically<br />reducing them to Joe next door?  The practice reeks of that sickening political<br />tactic of &#8220;everymanism,&#8221; where the people who have the power to make and break<br />lives want to appear as innocuous and ineffectual as, well, you.<br /><br /><br /><br />Fuck that.  You can call me Mister Payne.</p><br />
