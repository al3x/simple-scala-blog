<h1>A Panacea for Hostility</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I&#8217;m still feeling pretty bent out of shape over Eldred vs Ashcroft, which<br />is linked to bloodly well everywhere and doesn&#8217;t need any further griping<br />about, not today anyway.  But I like hostile music for a hostile mood, and<br />the track &#8220;Motion Sickness&#8221; by Panacea fits the bill perfectly.  It&#8217;s<br />deep, dark jungle from a producer not afraid to break the production rules<br />of the drumn bass scene.  Grab it on my beloved &lt;a<br />href=&#8221;http://www.emusic.com/cd/10739/10739398.html&#8221;&gt;Emusic</a>.</p><br />
