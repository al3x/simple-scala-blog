<h1>First Radio Show of the Semester: Whoops.</h1>
--- <br />- <p>So, if any of you got the impression that this, the first day of the semester, was when I would be sending my first radio show over the airwaves and interweb, my apologies.  But it turns out that <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">WMBC</span></span></span></span> radio doesn&#8217;t start until the coming Monday.  So the first show will be then.  Deal.</p><br />
