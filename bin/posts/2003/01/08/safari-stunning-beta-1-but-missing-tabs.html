<h1>Safari: Stunning Beta 1, But Missing Tabs</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>J&#8217;adore Safari.  It was love at first sight, with its sleek metal interface<br />and ultrafast page rendering.  It just screams <i>Apple</i>, and <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">OS X</span></span></span></span> needed<br />a browser with that degree of sheer sexiness.  That said, Safari lacks the best<br />feature of Opera and Chimera, the two other rebel browsers: tabs.  Tabs make<br />a lot of sense for a browser: most people usually open several pages.<br />Why give each page its own window, repeating all the navigational controls<br />and littering the screen?  Why not tabs, to switch easily between pages?<br />Chimera does this with superb results.  So if you miss this in Safari, sign<br /><a href=\"http://www.petitiononline.com/safaritb/petition.html\">the petition</a>.<br />Apple tends to be pretty responsive about these things.  Now, back to the jungle&#8230;</p>"<br />
