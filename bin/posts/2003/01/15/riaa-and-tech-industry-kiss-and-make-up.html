<h1>RIAA and the Tech Industry Kiss and Make Up?</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Several media sources, including the hometown &lt;a<br />href=&#8221;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A55542-2003Jan14.html&#8221;&gt;Washington<br />Post</a>, reported that various members of the tech industry and big media<br />decided not to persue legislatively mandated electronic copyright<br />enforcement.  What does that mean?  It means big media (the <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">RIAA</span></span></span></span>, but not<br />the <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">MPAA</span></span></span></span>) won&#8217;t go to Congress to get computer and electronics makers to<br />put chips in their products that do &#8220;Digital Rights Management.&#8221;  But note<br />the abscence of the <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">MPAA</span></span></span></span>: Hillary Rosen and her<br />record industry cronies are running out of money and/or patience with<br />their war on music &#8220;piracy,&#8221; but Jack Valenti and his movie industry<br />folks<br />aren&#8217;t.  And yet, Rosen is not really losing out.  She now has major<br />players in the tech biz like <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">IBM</span></span></span></span>, Microsoft, Intel, and Dell committed (or<br />so they say) to &#8220;aggressive enforcement against digital pirates,&#8221; whatever<br />that means and entails.<br /><br /><br /><br />The <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">RIAA</span></span></span></span> may have dropped the call for some sort<br />of technical solution, the sort I witnessed tech giants like<br />Phillips telling Valenti and company were totally worthless, but they&#8217;ve<br />got a commitment from the techies to do <i>something</i> about all this<br /><i>awful</i> piracy.  But, if not a legislatively mandated technical<br />solution of the hardware variety, what can the techs offer?  Software?<br/><br />That&#8217;s arguably even weaker in terms of defeatability of copy protection.<br/><br />I guess they could write pleading messages on the <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">MP3</span></span></span></span> players they sell in<br />vast quantity (&#8220;<i>please</i> don&#8217;t pirate music.  Please?  C&#8217;mon, be a<br />sport..&#8221;).<br /><br /><br /><br />But regardless of all this mess, I&#8217;m psyched that John McCain<br />is now heading the Senate Commerce Committee, previously run by Hollywood<br />puppet Ernest Hollings who&#8217;s had a hand in some nasty anti-tech,<br />anti-consumer, anti-American legislation.  Republicans (and McCain is only<br />Republican by title) are generally less inclined to sell out to Hollywood.<br/><br />My theory is Big Tobacco doesn&#8217;t like them traveling to cigarette-hostile<br />Los Angeles.</p>"<br />
