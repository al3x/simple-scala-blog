<h1>Stuff From the Microsound List</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I&#8217;m a happy subscriber to <a href="http://www.anechoicmedia.com/index2.htm">Kim Cascone&#8217;s</a> &lt;a<br />href=&#8221;http://www.microsound.org&#8221;&gt;microsound</a> discussion list.  I get<br />the list in digest format, as it&#8217;s fairly high-traffic.  But the dicussion<br />and reccomendations, both musical and otherwise, are worth sifting through<br />the lengthy digests.  If not for .microsound, how would I have found &lt;a<br />href=&#8221;http://www.nullpointer.co.uk&#8221;&gt;Null Pointer</a> and his &lt;a<br />href=&#8221;http://q-q-q.net/&#8221;&gt;wacky art-project Quake mod</a>?  And on the<br />audio side, the list<br />pointed me to Stephan Mathieu&#8217;s &lt;a<br />href=&#8221;http://www.12k.com/term/term04.htm&#8221;&gt;&#8221;the sad mac live at mutek<br />2002</a> and further <a href="http://www.12k.com/term/">downloadables</a><br />from minimal electronic record label 12k.<br /><br /><br /><br />But, quality links or not, those unfamiliar with the list and the genre<br />ask, &#8220;what the hell is microsound?&#8221;  The best way I can describe it (and<br />these genre things are tricky and pointless) is to say it&#8217;s &#8220;post-IDM,&#8221; in<br />the same way that one refers to &#8220;post-Rock.&#8221;  Post-Rock is shoegazing<br />music, as arty and academic and rock can be.  Similarly, if <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">IDM</span></span></span></span> is our<br />&#8220;classic rock&#8221;,<br />then microsound is <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">IDM</span></span></span></span>&#8217;s successor, though less for shoegazing than<br />art-gallery soundscapes, armchair post-postmodern philosophy, maybe even<br />programming (as long as your code comes out minimal).  Microsound is one<br />of those expansive genre definitions that appear so often in the<br />electronic music world, claiming artists past and present and ready to<br />swallow up those to come.  But, with communities like Cascone&#8217;s list, this<br />expansiveness is a positive invitation to participation.</p><br />
