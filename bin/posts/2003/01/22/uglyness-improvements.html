<h1>Uglyness, Improvements</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Some changes in layout are, quite obviously, taking place.  It&#8217;s hard to find a format for weblogs that&#8217;s readable, attractive, clean, and renderable in most modern browsers.  Not so hard, however, that a few designs haven&#8217;t become quite popular.  The look I&#8217;m using is adapted from a number of places, but <a href="http://www.waferbaby.com">Waferbaby</a> is my biggest source of inspiration (cheers!).  Bear with me through some glitches and shifting, and things should come up roses.</p><br />
