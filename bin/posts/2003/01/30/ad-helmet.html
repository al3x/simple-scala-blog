<h1>The Ad Helmet</h1>
--- <br />- <p>If you use Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> browser and don&#8217;t find that internet advertising lights up your world, try <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/18158">Pith Helment</a>.  Just drop it into <i>home</i>/Library/InputManagers/ (create the last folder if it doesn&#8217;t exist) and restart Safari.  Poof!  No ad banners, but the layout of your favorite pages is still maintained.  Oh yeah, and it&#8217;s freeware.  Keen!</p><br />
