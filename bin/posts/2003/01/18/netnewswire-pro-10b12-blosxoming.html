<h1>NetNewsWire Pro 1.0b12: Blosxoming</h1>
--- <br />- <p>&#8220;This release adds better support for Blosxom and Blosxom-compatible weblogs.&#8221;  That means, say, this one.  So now I can post to my blog from inside the app I find most of my links in.  And even if I&#8217;m not linking to some story, Ranchero Software has made the blogging interface in NetNewsWire Pro such a joy to use that it&#8217;s worth firing up for even a totally un-newsy post.  Huzzah!  Now if Rael would just get moving on that Blosxom update&#8230;</p><br />
