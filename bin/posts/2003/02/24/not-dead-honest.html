<h1>Not Dead. Honest.</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I had my first major problem with my iBook these past few days.  Having decided on Native Instrument&#8217;s Reaktor as the synthesis tool of choice for the album I&#8217;m working on, I now had to find a way to run the Mac <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS 9</span></span></span></span>-only software.  Yes, Reaktor 3 only works in the old school Mac OS, and despite my love for all things <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">X I</span></span></span></span>&#8217;m using it anyway, because it beats the pants off everything else and I can&#8217;t wait until the April release of <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span></span></span>-compatible Reaktor 4.  So I did something stupid and tried to do a &#8220;Software Restore&#8221; of <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS 9</span></span></span></span> on top of my <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span></span></span> installation, which confused my poor iBook something terrible when I rebooted.  My machine had no idea what, or seemingly <i>how</i>, to boot.  I had myself a good panic, then offloaded all my files onto two friends&#8217; iBooks using the nifty boot-as-Firewire feature Apple so thoughtfully includes.  Some partitioning and recopying later I have my iBook back in peak health, booting both OSs 9 and X and ready to work in Reaktor.  So how was your weekend?</p><br />
