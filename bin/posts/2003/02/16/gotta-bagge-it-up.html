<h1>Gotta Bagge It Up</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Reason magazine is presently running a <a href=\"http://www.reason.com/0303/bagge.shtml\">short comic</a> by Peter Bagge that muses on the ineffectiveness and embarrassments of the American antiwar movement.  He&#8217;s a Libertarian of the school that makes me almost identify with that platform, and his criticisms are both apt and biting.  Quote of the day (referring to the  Isreali/Palestinian conflict): &#8220;I [...] resent being forced to subsidize a staging ground for Armageddon, but does that mean I have to &#8216;root&#8217; for the Palestinians?  Can&#8217;t I loathe both sides equally?  Where&#8217;s the &#8216;they can all go to hell&#8217; booth?  I want to volunteer!&#8221;  I think I&#8217;ve said as much, many times over.  Right on topic, the <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0214/p02s02-ussc.html\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">CSM</span></span></span></span></a> has an article questioning the effectiveness of protests.  The pro-protesters resounding chorus?  &#8220;It worked for Vietnam&#8230;&#8221;  <em>cough</em></p>"<br />
