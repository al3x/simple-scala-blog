<h1>Libertarian Sentiments on this Weekend&#8217;s Protests</h1>
--- <br />- |<br />  <p>Two wonderful excerpts from reactions to this weekend&#8217;s worldwide protests, courtesy of British Libertarian blog <a href="http://www.samizdata.net/blog/">Samizdata.net</a>:</p><br /><br /><br />- |<br />  <blockquote>&#8220;Their act of protest is a far cry from a reasoned consideration of facts, the reality of international politics, of Iraq and the suffering of its people under Saddam or Iraq&#8217;s threat to the Western world. Theirs is a response based on emotions only, without thinking of the consequences of such action. Hate America? Join the protest. Hate Bush and the Republicans? Join the protest. Hate Tony Blair and the government? Join the protest. Hate Israel? Join the protest. Hate politicians? Join the protest. Hate the fact nobody takes you seriously? Join the protest. Hate your mediocre existence? Join the protest. Hate rational discourse? Join the protest. Miss the marches of the communists, peace movements, anti-Vietnam protesters etc of the Cold War era? Feel inadequate or need to feel important? Join the protest.&#8221;</blockquote><br /><br /><br />- |<br />  <p>...and number two:</p><br /><br /><br />- |<br />  <blockquote>&#8220;For what did we see on Saturday in London and elsewhere? Warmed-over Cold War moral equivalencers and Communist fellow-travellers; various latter-day Marxoid sectarians; geriatric Aldermaston veterans and other one-sided nuclear<br /> disarmers; &#8216;smash Anglo-Saxon civilisation&#8217; multiculturalists; assorted celebrity egotists; outright pro-Saddamites; anti-globalisation nihilists; re-invigorated public-sector trades unionists; UN-supporting single-world-governancers; full-time protesters-without-a-cause; liars and fantasists; pan-Arab socialists; Green nature worshippers; anti-Semites; &#8216;nice&#8217; middle-class people who are &#8220;worried about their children&#8217;s future&#8221; and who voted for the Greens in the 1980s and latterly and ironically for Blair and New Labour; insolent purveyors of an alien and wicked Islamic creed; immigrant welfare-spongers; those who simply think that evil is good and vice-versa; and Lord alone knows who else.&#8221;</blockquote><br /><br /><br />- <p>It&#8217;s not that I support this impending war.  I just don&#8217;t think physical-space protests are anything more than a wasteful ego exercise for those involved.</p><br />
