<h1>A Good Week (or so) for Software</h1>
--- <br />- |<br />  <p>It&#8217;s not often you get a week(ish) full of software presents, but these past few days have been Christmas in codeland:<br /></p><br /><br /><br />- "<ul><br /><li>Brett over at Ranchero released <a href=\"http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/\">NetNewsWire 1.0</a>, which I feel a little sentimental over after downloading every freakin&#8217; public beta and filing some bugs towards better Blosxom weblog editing support.  <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">NNW</span></span></span></span>, in addition to be the best <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">RSS</span></span></span></span> newsfeed reader in the metaverse, now posts to just about any type of weblog you can think of, and from an interface that takes full advantage of Mac <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">OS X</span></span></span></span>&#8217;s Cocoa programming/interface enhancements.  I use it to post to this blog, and the info junkie in me would go through nasty Trainspotting-style withdrawl without its elegant <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">RSS</span></span></span></span> browsing.<br />&lt;!<del><del>more</del></del>&gt;<br /><br /></li><br /><li>Speaking of <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">OS X</span></span></span></span>, Apple released a largely bug-fix <a href=\"http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=107362\">update</a> for <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">OS X</span></span></span></span>, bringing the version up to 10.2.4.<br /></li><br /><li>Apple also updated two of its spiffy Macworld betas, the <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">KHTML</span></span></span></span>-based ultrafast <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/safari/\">Safari</a> browser and their Quartz-enhanced (read: &#8220;really pretty&#8221;) <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">X11</span></span></span></span></a> implementation.  I haven&#8217;t used the <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">X11</span></span></span></span> client extensively, but Safari is rapidly maturing, and is now able to handle my online banking site, totally negating the need for any other browser on my system.  It&#8217;s still not perfect, but lead programming <a href=\"http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/\">Dave Hyatt</a> is working hard.<br /></li><br /><li><a href=\"http://www.raelity.org\">Rael</a> and the gang not only got out the door a stable version of <a href=http://www.raelity.org/apps/blosxom/\">Blosxom</a>, the weblog engine that powers this site, but they hacked together a superclean Mac <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">OS X</span></span></span></span> <a href=\"http://www.raelity.org/apps/blosxom/downloads/Blosxom_1_2_for_MacOSX.tar.gz\">install package</a> that can have you hosting your own Blosxom blog from your Mac in minutes!  I&#8217;m still waiting with baited breath for the Blosxom 2 beta code so I can experiment with comments and TrackBacks here.<br /></li><br /><li>I try not to mess with the <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">OS X</span></span></span></span> appearance too much, in part because endless appearance hacking is a waste of time, but in part because the interface is gorgeous out of the box.  But I&#8217;m not crazy about the default icons, particularly in conjunction with the understated graphite theme that Apple provides as relief from the candy colors of the default Aqua scheme.  Fortunately there&#8217;s Panic/Iconfactory&#8217;s recently updated <a href=\"http://www.iconfactory.com/cb_home.asp\">Candy Bar</a>, the latest revision of which supports &#8220;iContainers,&#8221; system-wide icon themes.  I&#8217;ve made one of <a href=\"http://www.rad-e8.com/\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">RAD</span></span></span></span>.E8</a>&#8217;s &#8220;Snow.E 2&#8221; icons, which are smooth, clean, and snowy while keeping the general Aqua gloss: perfect for iBook users.  In the same vein, don&#8217;t forget the Iconfactory&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.iconfactory.com/ip_home.asp\">iPulse</a> system monitoring tool, which is worth the meager asking price in utility <em>and</em> creativity.  Whew, that&#8217;ll have to do it for now: too much stuff to play with!</li><br /></ul>"<br />
