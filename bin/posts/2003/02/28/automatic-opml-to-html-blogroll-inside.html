<h1>Automatic OPML-to-HTML Blogroll Inside Moveable Type?</h1>
--- <br />- <p>My news feed reader of choice, NetNewsWire, can export the list of news feeds I read in an <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">XML</span></span></span></span>-ish format called <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">OPML</span></span></span></span>.  It would make a lot of sense to have a Moveable Type plugin that grabbed an <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">OPML</span></span></span></span> file, either from the web or from a directory on your server, and converted it to a nice, configurable <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTML</span></span></span></span> list.  Obviously the plugin would add a handfull of tags to MT, but if you had some time (I don&#8217;t) and could hack some Perl (I won&#8217;t) it would be doable.  Heck, the <a href="http://www.radwin.org/michael/blog/archives/000104.html">pieces</a> are already in place.  So, <a href="http://www.lazyweb.org/">Lazyweb</a>, anyone?</p><br />
