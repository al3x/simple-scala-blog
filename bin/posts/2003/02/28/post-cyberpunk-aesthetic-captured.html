<h1>The Post-Cyberpunk Aesthetic, Captured</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>I hate to repost from <a href=\"http://memepool.com/\">Memepool</a>, but motion graphics/audio collective <a href=\"http://www.pleix.net/\">Pleix</a> elegantly captures in their works what I&#8217;ve long pictured to be a post-cyberpunk aesthetic.  Their video for Plaid&#8217;s &#8220;Itsu,&#8221; for example, has all the simultaneous lust and fear for technology and the future of classic cyberpunk, but conducts itself less like an angry mosh-pit kid and more like a subversively slick made-it-through-the-Dot-Bomb&#8217;er.  The post-cyberpunk aesthetic leaves behind the &#8220;corporate apocolypse&#8221; images of early Gibson for, well, the corporate fetishism of present Gibson.  Let me put it typographically: if distressed, pixelated fonts were old cyberpunk, Pleix&#8217;s commanding, clean sans-serif type somehow carries all the implications of the old while looking gorgeous.  It&#8217;s scary, it&#8217;s seductive, and it&#8217;s supposed to be.</p>"<br />
