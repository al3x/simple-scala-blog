<h1>Eat Your Heart Out, Steven Wolfram</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I think it&#8217;s pretty funny that Sean Booth, one half of experimental electronic gods Autechre, <a href="http://www.autechre.nu/cgi-bin/newspro/interviews.cgi?newsid1004112934,55737,">thinks</a> Steven Wolfram&#8217;s nature-as-cellular-automata thesis is crap.  It&#8217;s quite an interview, actually, because the more you dig through Booth&#8217;s working class English slang and modesty-cum-hostility, you realize he&#8217;s got an understanding of complex systems, both technical and natural, that probably rivals some academics.  I&#8217;m just happy he&#8217;s using that understanding to make music and not dry academic papers.</p><br />
