<h1>&#8220;Open&#8221; Record Label Already Exists!</h1>
--- <br />- <p>It looks like the kids at <a href="http://src.devdsp.net/">devdsp src</a> beat me to the punch with &#8220;my&#8221; idea for an open record label that releases the source code/sounds/files for all the music they release.  In the age of totally digital music production, all you need is the same software to be able to tweak and remix their work, and that&#8217;s an amazing thing!  But too many labels and artists insist on hand-picking who gets to remix their work, making it that much more difficult for amateur remixers to do great things.  I&#8217;m glad to see devdsp src is setting a new trend, and one I hope to incorporate in me and my mates&#8217; <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=acesulfamek&amp;itemid=11048">Next Big Project</a>.</p><br />
