<h1>Programming and the al3x</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Just finished up my last CompSci <a href="http://www.cs.umbc.edu/courses/undergraduate/201/spring03/projects/p5/">assignment</a> for the semester.  My implementation compiles, runs, but is lacking one (somewhat minor) detail and spits out one bit of garbage fairly consistently (without segfaulting).  I&#8217;m happy enough with it.<br /><br /><br /><br />These past two semesters have been the first formal computer programming training I&#8217;ve ever had.  Up until now I&#8217;ve dabbled and taught myself, learning and inferring from other people&#8217;s code.  Most of my experience has been with scripting languages, and often with rather peculiar APIs (for example, the implementation of JavaScript inside Adobe Acrobat).  So learning C in fair detail has been a neat experience.  I&#8217;ve discovered that I&#8217;m a pretty adequate programmer; no brilliant hacks, but solid and readable code.  I&#8217;m going on next semester to do C++, and I&#8217;m sure object oriented programming, which I at least grasp conceptually, will be another fun challenge.  From there, I&#8217;ve designed my custom major to jump around the Computer Science and Information Systems courses a bit, as I&#8217;m not interested in being a full-fledged Computer Scientist.  But learning programming in a formal environment has been far more palatable, and more importantly <i>educational</i>, than I ever expected.  All that said, linked lists in C suck <sup>_</sup></p><br />
