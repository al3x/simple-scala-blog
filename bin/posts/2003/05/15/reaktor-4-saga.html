<h1>The Reaktor 4 Saga</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Okay, maybe it&#8217;s not much of a saga.  But the damn thing has been delayed for like <i>ever</i>.  Since Reaktor 3 users were promised some critical bug fixes many moons ago, some irate Native Instruments customers are calling Reaktor 4 an update that&#8217;s been years in the making.  But you know it&#8217;s gotten bad when, 24 hours before the update is supposed be updated online, Reaktor users close to NI&#8217;s headquarters in Berlin are <a href="http://www.nativeinstruments.de/forum/showthread.php?s=8a35a70dcf203c6a5c867856374f80c4&amp;threadid=4057">planning road trips</a> to assault the NI staff if it&#8217;s delayed any longer.</p><br />
