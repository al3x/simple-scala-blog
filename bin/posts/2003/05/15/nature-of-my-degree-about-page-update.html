<h1>The Nature of My Degree, About Page Update</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I met with my academic advisor this morning, and amidst figuring out my fall schedule we talked about how my interdisciplinary degree is working/going to work.  Technically, I don&#8217;t submit a &#8220;major proposal&#8221; until I&#8217;ve got 60 credits under my belt, so the final details are a ways off.  But I was informed that I&#8217;m not looking at a BS, but rather a BA.  You have to take a heck of a lot of natural/computer science courses to get an interdisciplinary BS.  My course of study gets the majority of its tech material from the Information Systems program here, and <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">IFSM</span></span></span></span> classes aren&#8217;t a science credit like formal Computer Science is.  I suppose it&#8217;s not a problem, since I&#8217;m not looking for a programming job when I get out of school.  But, should I need to due a bad economy or whathaveyou, it&#8217;ll be that much harder.  Hmm.<br /><br /><br /><br />At any rate, my <a href="http://www.al3x.net/about.html">&#8220;about&#8221;</a> page has been updated accordingly, and some of the biographical information made generally more readable.  Ah, the delights of formal education.</p><br />
