<h1>More &#8216;Reloaded&#8217; Thoughts</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>It seems the reviewer for Salon <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2003/05/15/matrix_reloaded/print.html\">felt the same way I did</a> about the &#8216;rave in the cave&#8217; scene: &#8220;a celebration of the sheer sensuous delight we all share (or should share, anyway) just at being alive, experiencing the world with our own bodies and our own minds.&#8221;  I also thought the racial politics of the film were handled perfectly.  Which is to say, there were no &#8220;racial politics.&#8221;  Everyone was on equal footing.  Zion, the last human city, was understandably portrayed as multiracial, and in the aforementioned scene revelers of all races danced the night away, together.  Strong black men and women were portrayed at the forefront of the military and political organizations, and none of them came off as the insulting caricatures of &#8220;minorities&#8221; we&#8217;ve come to expect from Hollywood.  There were just so many damn reasons I liked &#8216;Reloaded.&#8217;  I wanna go again, I wanna go again!</p>"<br />
