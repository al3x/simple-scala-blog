<h1>Live Performance: Fun</h1>
--- <br />- <p>That went well.  The crowd of roughly 40 was certainly the most people I&#8217;ve ever played my own music for, though fewer than I&#8217;ve DJed for.  I couldn&#8217;t see into the darkness of the crowd from the dimly lit stage and the fog of laptop glare, but apparently I didn&#8217;t drive anyone from the performance space.  Friends said the set was good and I got a couple approving nods and thumbs-up from random attendees, performers and listeners alike.  Labelmate and comrade 5dots preceded me with a bruttally aryhmtic and deliciously noisy set.  Other performers there varied in skill and style and a couple (who&#8217;s names I can&#8217;t recall, but will attempt to find out) stood out.  None were so appealing, however, as to approach them for potential work with our fledgling label.  On the whole it was a fun evening, both as listener and performer; live performance is something I&#8217;ll have to pursue in the future.  My set, straight off the ones-and-zeros, will be made available <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">ASAP</span></span></span></span> on the presently under-construction Adjective Records website.</p><br />
