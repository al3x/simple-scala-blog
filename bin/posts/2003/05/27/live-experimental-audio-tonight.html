<h1>Live Experimental Audio Tonight</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Myself and Adjective Records co-founder <a href="http://www.5dots.net">5dots</a> will be playing at the <a href="http://www.blackcatdc.com">Black Cat</a> here in DC this evening.  Far from getting our own gig, we&#8217;re just playing short sets at the free-for-all &#8220;Open Minijax&#8221; event organized by Derek Morton (of the <a href="http://www.mikronytes.com">Mikronytes</a>), part of his <a href="http://www.mikroknytes.com/techclub/">Tech Club</a> series of electronic audio happenings.  Barring any logistical or technical disasters, I should be playing a good 15 minutes of synthesized and resampled drones melded with intercepted Russian spy transmissions off my iBook.  Good family fun.<br /><br /><br /><br />If you&#8217;d like to say &#8220;die,&#8221; stop by and do so, it&#8217;s only $5.  I&#8217;ll be the dorkus with the iBook and spikey hair in a black t-shirt.  Err, one of about twenty.  God bless the post-techno scene.</p><br />
