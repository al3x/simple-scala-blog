--- <br />- <p>I really like <a href="http://au.gu.st">Au</a>, and for the least of reasons.  It installs a bunch of stuff that turns any <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span></span></span>-running Mac into a portable mail server, capable of sending and receiving mail quite quickly and securely.  It even broadcasts this capability over Rendezvous, so you can exchange mail with people even when there&#8217;s no connection to the outside Internet.  But what I love is that it adds, without any tweaking, a really good <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">SMTP</span></span></span></span> (outgoing mail) server to your machine.  My university only lets us send mail through their <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">SMTP</span></span></span></span> servers on campus, so I have to change my Mail settings whenever I leave campus.  Ditto for the Earthlink connection at home &#8211; you can&#8217;t use their <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">SMTP</span></span></span></span> servers if you&#8217;re not on an Earthlink connection.  But with Au, my Mac is its own <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">SMTP</span></span></span></span> server, and I can send outgoing mail from anywhere without editing a damn thing.  Also a bonus if your <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">ISP</span></span></span></span>&#8217;s <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">SMTP</span></span></span></span> server is frequently down, or has odd limitations.  Good stuff.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPDATE</span></span></span></span>:</strong> Turns out that my university&#8217;s residential network blocks any outgoing <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">SMTP</span></span></span></span> traffic that isn&#8217;t destined for their servers in an effort to fight spam from the dorms.  Au still can&#8217;t help me here, nor do I expect it to.  Damn you, spammers, ruining my interweb&#8230;</p><br />
