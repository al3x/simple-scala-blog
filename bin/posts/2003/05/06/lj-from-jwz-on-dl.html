<h1>LJ from JWZ (on the DL?)</h1>
--- <br />- <p><a href="http://www.jwz.org">jwz</a> was nice enough to give me a LiveJournal invite code after reading my <a href="http://www.al3x.net/mt/archives/000152.html">Adbusters rant</a>, so now I <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/al3xpayne/">have one</a>.  Not sure what I&#8217;d use it for, save posting comments on other people&#8217;s LJs, but what the hell.  Would you refuse an invitation from jwz?  No sir, you would not.</p><br />
