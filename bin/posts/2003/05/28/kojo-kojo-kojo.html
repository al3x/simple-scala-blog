<h1>Kojo Kojo Kojo!</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I was driving home from my first exciting day of summer school and the associated 80 mile roundtrip commute, pumping DC-area <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">NPR</span></span></span></span> affiliate <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">WAMU</span></span></span></span>, as I&#8217;ve been known to do.  Lo and behold, radio interviewer <em>par excellence</em> <a href="http://www.wamu.org/kojo/index.html">Kojo Nnamdi</a> is doing <a href="http://www.wamu.org/ram/2003/k1030527.ram">a show on e-Government</a>, my very own and most favorite field of study!  So what could I do but call in?  They very pleasantly accepted my question, which was the extent to which Kojo&#8217;s guests, from both private industry and government, felt it was appropriate for e-Government technologies developed with public funds to be released to the public as open source and/or developed to open standards.  I asked not because I believe this should be the case, but because my opinion on the matter waffles, and I was interested in the thoughts of people who work in the field.  The open source part of the question was avoided, but all parties seemed to heartily endorse open standards.  At any rate, I&#8217;d never called in to a show before, so it was kind of fun.  That, and I just like saying &#8220;Kojo.&#8221;</p><br />
