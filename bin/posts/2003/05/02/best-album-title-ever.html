<h1>Best Album Title Ever</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>I&#8217;ve always been one for creative and amusing album titles (and band names, for that matter).  I think, when exploring the discography of an artist I&#8217;m really into at the moment, I found my personal favorite to date: <a href=\"http://www.klangstabil.com/hymen/all/y405.html\">&#8220;A Giant Alien Force More Violent &amp; Sick Than Anything You Can Imagine&#8221;</a> by Venetian Snares (<a href=\"http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/v/venetian-snares/a-giant-alien-force-more-violent-and-sick-than-anything-you-can-imagine.shtml\">review</a>).  The album just happens to come in <a href=\"http://www.klangstabil.com/hymen/all/y405-packaging-xs.jpg\">really cool packaging</a>.</p>"<br />
