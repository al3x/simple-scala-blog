<h1>Summer Session In Full Swing</h1>
--- <br />- <p>As per the title, summer session is in full swing.  I&#8217;ve got about seven more weeks of Spanish 101 and Biology 100, only the first of which I&#8217;m enjoying.  Spanish is a colorful, satisfying language to speak; you get to open your mouth wide, roll your r&#8217;s, and generally be linguistically flamboyant, at least compared to English.  The downside of summer session is that all the things I wanted/intended to do with all my &#8220;summer free time&#8221; have now gone back to the backburner (rebackburned?).  But I do intend to get the Adjective Records site up and operational, if not its e-commerce components.  Hopefully I can track down a job for the second half of summer, too.  It&#8217;s all very odd, though, as the weather in DC/Baltimore feels like early spring, summer activities thus seeming utterly unapropos.</p><br />
