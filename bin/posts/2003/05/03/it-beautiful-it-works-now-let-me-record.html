<h1>It&#8217;s Beautiful, It Works, Now Let Me Record!</h1>
--- <br />- <p>My new 30GB iPod is, in a word, sextastic.  I&#8217;ll also accept &#8220;supercalafragilistic.&#8221;  Not only is it, from the packaging to the device itself, a total <i>object</i> (read in dripping French accent), but its ease of use is unparalleled.  There was no geek-out time necessary.  That is to say, the time I had reserved to &#8220;figure out how to get it working&#8221; was utterly unnecessary.  Plugged it into my iBook, it found iTunes, synced and charged, and a couple hours later I was blasting Venetian Snares down I-95 (via a little <a href="http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Merchant_Id=&amp;Section_Id=201526&amp;pcount=&amp;Product_Id=140984">Belkin FM adaptor</a>, which, for the record, is passable but far from <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/itrip/">elegant</a>).  I was almost dumbfounded, particularly after years of fighting to get anything at all to interface with Linux.  It&#8217;s just so utterly elegant.<br /><br /><br /><br />What&#8217;s more, it turns Apple <i>did</i> <a href="http://www.ipoding.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1135&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0">add line-in recording capability</a> to the new iPods, and they <a href="http://www.ipoding.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1138&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0">may be releasing an adaptor</a> to enable this feature in the near future.  This rocked my world.  I&#8217;ve wanted, for years, a portable digital recording device that doesn&#8217;t <a href="http://www.archos.com/lang=en//products/prw_500277.html">suck</a>.  As an (amateur) electronic musician, being able to record any interesting sound I come across would be a total godsend.  It&#8217;s the audio equivalent of always having a camera on you.  If Apple (or a third party manufacturer) can really make this happen, I&#8217;ll plotz.  And then I&#8217;ll give them my money.</p><br />
