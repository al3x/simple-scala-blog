<h1>iPod Car Mount</h1>
--- <br />- <p>For the record, the <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/product.asp?catalog%5Fname=CTLG&amp;category%5Fname=CTLG%5F001%5F004%5F008%5F002&amp;product%5Fid=17%2D548">Radio Shack AC Vent Wireless Phone Mount</a> repurposed for use with an iPod by the folks at <a href="http://www.ipoding.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=12">iPoding</a> works just peachy with the new 30GB.  I also improvised with a little <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/product.asp?catalog%5Fname=CTLG&amp;category%5Fname=CTLG%5F005%5F011%5F000%5F000&amp;product%5Fid=64%2D2360">adhesive velcro stuff</a> on my dashboard and the battery plate of my TuneCast to make a whole easily-removable iPod wonderland of my car.  Just slip the iPod in, snap the TuneCast onto the dash, turn it and the radio on, and I&#8217;m groovin&#8217;.<br/><br /><br /><br /><br />With the car mount problem solved, now I need a decent case that lets me use the iPod while still protecting it.  Given that the device has been out for mere days, however, I&#8217;m expecting some waiting.  Insofar as inspiring total overprotectiveness, the gorgeous finish of the iPod is almost a detriment.  Almost.</p><br />
