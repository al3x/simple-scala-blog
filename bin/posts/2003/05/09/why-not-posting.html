<h1>Why The Not Posting?</h1>
--- <br />- <p>It&#8217;s not like I don&#8217;t have things to say, I&#8217;m just too busy to say them.  And it sure didn&#8217;t help that some badly written C for a computer science class b0rked my computer pretty good.  All languages should do automatic memory management (oh yeah, I know, don&#8217;t blame the tools, blame the programmer &#8211; blame is squarely on me, I assure you).  One too many malloc()&#8217;s gone awry, looped a couple hundred times, does odd things, even to <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span></span></span>.  Backed up to the iPod, reinstalled, things are fine.  Very burnt out, and still about another week of school to go.  Well, keep yourself amused with Warren Ellis&#8217;s fantastic blog <a href="http://www.diepunyhumans.com">Die Puny Humans</a>.  It felt like a more genuine, down-to-earth BoingBoing until today&#8217;s discussion of &#8220;social software&#8221; <em>cough</em>bullshit<em>cough</em>, but most of the time it&#8217;s just neat crap.  More when my optic nerves aren&#8217;t actively trying to beat the rest of my brain into submission.</p><br />
