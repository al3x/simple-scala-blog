<h1>Been A Long, Long Time Gone</h1>
--- <br />- <p>My first year of college?  Check.  Put the nail in that coffin about midnight Tuesday when I zapped my final end-of-term essay to my prof for an economics/law/political philosophy seminar called &#8220;What Should Government Do?&#8221;  It was my favorite course this semester, and hopefully an opportunity that will continue to be available to Freshman as part of <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">UMBC</span></span></span></span>&#8217;s &#8220;First Year Seminar.&#8221;  I may actually be a research/teaching assistant for another prof teaching a rather neat <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">FYS</span></span></span></span> this coming Fall semester, but I&#8217;ll wait until the details are concrete before posting any more on that.<br /><br /><br /><br />But it&#8217;s so, so nice to be done.  As much as I&#8217;ve enjoyed this first year, it&#8217;s been odd not shirking my work to read (non-assigned books) voraciously, as I did throughout most of my education thusfar.  College has actually been engaging enough to warrant <em>staying on task</em>, and that&#8217;s a total first.  But, that said, there&#8217;s been so much I simply haven&#8217;t had the time and energy to do after attending to my studies (like blogging for about the past week), and now I have the time to do them.  At least until summer school starts&#8230;</p><br />
