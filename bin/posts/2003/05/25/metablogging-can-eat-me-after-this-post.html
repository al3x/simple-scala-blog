<h1>Metablogging Can Eat Me (After This Post)</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Seems like the same bloggers who talk endlessly about the transformative power of blog-journalism don&#8217;t talk about much more than the blog scene itself (<a href=\"http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001043.shtml\">case in point</a>).  Reality check: blogs aren&#8217;t cool, cool ideas are cool.  Blogs just happen to be the means to get those ideas out there, and I&#8217;m pretty damn sick of medium-as-message.  Wanna transform the nature of journalism and information dissemination?  Write about something other than blogging!  This is but a small part of my increasing boredom with the pervasive tech-for-the-sake-of-tech attitude of much of the digerati.  More on that later.</p>"<br />
