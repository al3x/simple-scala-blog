<h1>Scratched iBook Screen: Fixes?</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>My iBook has had a pretty good life: padded cases, frequent cleanings, general love and care.  So when a small-but-aggravatingly-noticable scratch appeared in the lower-right quadrant of its screen this evening it was a shock for both the machine and I.  The iBook wasn&#8217;t near anything that might have caused the scratch, and I have a witness to that assertion.  But it is driving me nuts, and I&#8217;d love to hear some suggestions.<br /><br /><br /><br />What say you all?  Is there a decent way of buffing out or otherwise removing this fingernail-edge-size scratch?  For the love of God say yes&#8230;</p>"<br />
