<h1>Tweaks</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I changed the ubiquitous <a href="http://gtmcknight.com/buttons/index.php">link buttons</a> that had been in the &#8220;Details&#8221; section of the right navigation bar to faster and more bandwidth-friendly <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CSS</span></span></span></span>.  The &#8220;buttons&#8221; are now basically some creative <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTML</span></span></span></span>, borrowed near-verbatim from the Great American Man of Jewfros, <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/">Chris Pirillo</a>.  Do you find them acceptable, or should I just eschew the whole button trend and go for straight text?<br /><br /><br /><br />Also new and notable is my Link Cosmos, powered by <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a>.  It shows all the people linking to me, and it&#8217;s updated whenever I post a new entry or otherwise modify the front page.  And yes, I&#8217;m aware that n3rd.net&#8217;s title has some odd formatting.  I&#8217;ve written the author of the <a href="http://mt-plugins.org/archives/entry/technorati_d.php">Moveable Type plugin</a> that lets me do this and hopefully he&#8217;ll have a suggestion of some sort, because god knows I&#8217;m not looking at his (or anyone else&#8217;s) regex-laden Perl.  So, neat new features.  If you want more you can always ask.  This ain&#8217;t no Oliver Twist orphanage crap&#8230;</p><br />
