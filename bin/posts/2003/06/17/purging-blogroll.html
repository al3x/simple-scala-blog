<h1>Purging the Blogroll</h1>
--- <br />- <p>It appears to be some sort of impromptu &#8220;summer cleaning&#8221; time in the digital home that is my iBook.  After skimming the crap out of my iTunes Library (and thus the iPod that syncs to it) I&#8217;m still itching for more refinement. Coincidentally I realized how much a number of my <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSS</span></span></span></span> subscriptions in NetNewsWire piss me off/are boring/are irrelevant.  What this is, of course, is a denouncement of these blogs, and their authors by proxy.  I was going to post the names of authors/blogs I&#8217;d denounced here, but that seems a bit <em>gauche</em>.  When I next update my blogroll those of you who really care can spot the differences.  All none of you.</p><br />
