<h1>TouchStream for PowerBook!</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Holy cats!  The geniuses at FingerWorks have made a <a href="http://www.fingerworks.com/TS_PowerBook.html">drop-in TouchStream keyboard</a> for Apple&#8217;s PowerBook G4!  It&#8217;s efficient keylessness to go!  If I had one of those aluminum beauties I&#8217;d be.. wishing it wasn&#8217;t so expensive.  For now I remain quite happy with my TouchStream ST, though I gather they&#8217;ve now collapsed that line into <a href="http://www.fingerworks.com/lp_product.html">TouchStream LP</a>, which can be both placed on a frame like the ST or folded up and taken with you.  Clever kids.</p><br />
