<h1>Working Title For &#8220;Next-Gen&#8221; Blog Engine</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Seeing as how the &#8216;replacement <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">RSS</span></span></span></span> and more&#8217; horde found themselves a project name (<a href=\"http://intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/RoadMap\">Echo</a>), it was about time we (myself and <a href=\"http://me.creativeloafing.org\">Phil</a>) did too.  Hence, the working title of our king-hell blog engine is <em>drumroll</em>: Sexxi.  Why, other than that it&#8217;s provocative, fairly Googlable (sp?), and brief?  Because, in fine Open Source tradition, it roughly stands for the things we want it to be: Social, EXtensible, and leXIcal.<br /><br /><br /><br />And the logo possibilites are <em>endless</em>.  But yeah, Echo.  We&#8217;ll support it, assuming it doesn&#8217;t suck, which I don&#8217;t think it will unless the very same political problems it in-part aims to solve rear their ugly heads anew.  But standards are a good thing.  I think a couple people agree.</p>"<br />
