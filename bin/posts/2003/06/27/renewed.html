<h1>Renewed</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Apologies to my regular readers and anyone else who had a desperate need for al3x and the information contained herein.  It was a bumpy transition to my new web host, largely due to Moveable Type&#8217;s flawed re-importation of its own archive format, which catalyzes a whole series of errors, DB_File corruptions, and so forth. But everything is back, minus a couple minor posts, and working far better than before, at least on the server end.  My blogroll is now dynamically generated from my newsreader&#8217;s exported <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">OPML</span></span></span></span> file and my Technorati Link Cosmos uses real honest-to-god <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">XML</span></span></span></span> parsing! All this means things will be fresher.  Lemon-fresher.<br /><br /><br /><br />However, as I hinted at before/during the server switch, I&#8217;m writing a new blog engine, ergo much of this may be moot in a (hopefully) short while.  It&#8217;s a project of a friend and I, and largely conceived by him, with a few minor suggestions contributed along the creative process (oh, and probably 90% of the implementation will be on me, but that remains to be seen).  But the basic problem we&#8217;re trying to solve is the lack of intelligent, lexical, dareisay <i>semantic</i> linkage between blogs and posts within blogs.  We think we can at least take a stab at this issue, fix some things (technical and political) that bug us about current blog engines, and learn Ruby all at once.  Yeah, we&#8217;re nuts.  Thanks for asking,<br /><br /><br /><br />But in the interim I&#8217;m gonna keep blogging my lil&#8217; heart out here, so keep it locked (preferably to the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSS 2</span></span></span></span> feed). Thanks for bearing with me.</p><br />
