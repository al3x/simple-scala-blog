<h1>Link Buttons Revisited</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Thanks to some differences between my layout/stylesheet and those of <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CSS</span></span></span></span> link button creator Chris Pirillo&#8217;s the lil&#8217; buggers don&#8217;t display uniformly across browsers.  Baffling as it may seem, more people look at my site with IE on Windows XP than any other browser/OS platform.  And last I looked at the site on that platform-o-browser-evil, the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CSS</span></span></span></span> link buttons misrendered.  So I&#8217;m thinking of dropping them in favor of plain ol&#8217; text.  Would that break your hearts?  And leave too few &#8220;grahics&#8221; on the page?  And do I need a new title bar image?  That shot of mine from Somewhere, Japan that&#8217;s been there since this site&#8217;s reincarnation is getting a bit tiresome I think, and I have ever so many <i>other</i> random shots from Japan I could stick there ;-)  Comments, people, really.</p><br />
