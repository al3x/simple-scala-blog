<h1>Party Party Par-tay</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I said party over here!  Party over there!  Party in the blogosphere!  Hmm, yes, that does look as painfully dorky in writing as I expected.  No matter, because there&#8217;s gonna be a sort of <a href="http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/PartyInDC030708">blog-celeb shindig</a> in DC coinciding with the <a href="http://www.pulver.com/supernova/">Supernova conference</a> on July 7th.  It&#8217;s a ways off yet but the planning stages are already in full swing.  I&#8217;m trying to have my organizational say, Wiki-style.  Surely there&#8217;s a place for us unknown minors amongst a crowd of mature professionals in the height of their notoriety?  Hmm.  That may be farther off than the whole &#8220;party over here&#8221; thing&#8230;</p><br />
