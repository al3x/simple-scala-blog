<h1>Worth Your Time</h1>
--- <br />- <p>While I&#8217;ve become increasingly skeptical about much of the &#8220;copyfight,&#8221; protecting a healthy public domain remains a good cause in my mind.  Clearly we&#8217;re not going to find profitable Intellectual Property (eg Mickey Mouse) in the commons anytime soon, and I&#8217;m not convinced we should.  But aging works no longer valuable to their creators should be moved to the public domain so as to find new intellectual and cultural worth, if not profitability.  If you agree, sign a <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/eldred/petition.html">petition in support of the Reclaim the Public Domain Act</a> (aka the Eldred Act, after the book publisher who fought the last Sonny Bono copyright extension act).  It&#8217;s worth a minute of your time if you enjoy, you know, culture.  Of any sort.</p><br />
