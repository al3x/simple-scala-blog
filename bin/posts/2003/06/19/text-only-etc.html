<h1>Text Only, Etc.</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Chris&#8217;s <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CSS</span></span></span></span> link buttons ended up not looking quite right across browsers, so I&#8217;ve ditched &#8216;em for plain text links.  It makes for a lot of text, but that&#8217;s what blogs are all about (and if <a href="http://crossroads.net/a/index.php">Adam</a> can do it, why can&#8217;t I?).<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#8217;ve also ditched the <i>link</i> to the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSS 1</span></span></span></span>.0 feed, but the feed itself remains.  I&#8217;m trying to ween people off of it but a fair number of you batards are persistant in subscribing to it.  Evolving standards, people, c&#8217;mon!  ;-)<br /><br /><br /><br />At any rate all these changes may be short-lived if my sooper-secret blog plans come to fruition.  And summer is a good season for fruition&#8230;</p><br />
