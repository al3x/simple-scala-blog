<h1>Ass-Haulin&#8217;</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Moving right along on the <a href="http://www.adjectiverecords.com/">Adjective Records</a> site.  That and Summer Session have been eating my time like some sort of ravenous time-eating eater of time.  But we&#8217;re moving towards a nice layout, and we&#8217;ll be one in what I assume to be a small of group of labels who blog.  I&#8217;m sure there are others, out there, somewhere.  But yeah, it&#8217;ll be a pretty keen site.  100% <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">XHTML</span></span></span></span> and <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CSS2</span></span></span></span>, complete with a modified navigation bar from the <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0603a.shtml#sawyer">Zeldman</a>.  I had cobbled my own together, but leave it to Zeldman to do it, you know, correctly.  More yet to be done.  Wish me godspeed.</p><br />
