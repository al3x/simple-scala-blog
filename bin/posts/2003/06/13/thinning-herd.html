<h1>Thinning the Herd</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>...where &#8220;herd&#8221; is to be read as &#8220;iTunes Music Library.&#8221;  I&#8217;ve dumped tons of albums I just don&#8217;t give a damn about anymore.  Yesterday alone several digitized discs of Plaid and Mu-Ziq bit the dust.  Over the past several weeks most of the melodic <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">IDM</span></span></span></span> in my collection had bitten the dust, save the innovators in the genre: Boards of Canada, Cex, and so forth.  That music is precious enough without poorly executed derivatives.  While I hate to see my library <i>decrease</i> in size, it&#8217;s nice not to have to skip through crap I just patently no longer like when listening to my whole library on shuffle.  Sorry, Plaid.</p>"<br />
