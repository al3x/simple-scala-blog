<h1>Security Doesn&#8217;t Mean Politics, DARPA</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Computer security was my main interest way before I got into the politech stuff, and I guess it pushed me in my present direction.  I&#8217;m not the best offensive hacker, but I&#8217;d like to think I run pretty good defense; I know of what I speak (for a change).  So when government types start talking security I get skeptical.  When they start throwing money around, I get critical.  And when they totally screw up where they put their (read: our) money, I get pissed.  And pissed is what I am, presently at <a href=\"http://www.darpa.mil/\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">DARPA</span></span></span></span></a>, who <a href=\"http://rss.com.com/2100-1016-997393.html?type=pt&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=news\">just withdrew the remaining portion of the funding</a> they promised to the <a href=\"http://www.openbsd.org\">OpenBSD project.</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">DARPA</span></span></span></span>&#8217;s public reasoning is that too much of the funding was going to non-US coders.  This is, of course, a totally inane justification.  Regardless of what flag the OpenBSD programmers salute, their code is open for all the world to check for, shall we say, <i>patriotic bias</i>.  Okay, forget being coy: it&#8217;s open source, and that means any backdoors these guys try to code in will eventually be brought to light.  What I&#8217;m guessing is going on behind the scenes, however, is that US security companies were pissed that this portion of the <a href=\"http://rss.com.com/2100-1014-996798.html?tag=nl\">post-9/11 security bounty</a> wasn&#8217;t going to them.  A sad minority of professional security types I&#8217;ve met really see security as an ethical priority, and if it&#8217;s not a ethics at work then it&#8217;s likely greed.  Ten taxpayer bucks earmarked for infosec says that&#8217;s what&#8217;s up.<br /><br /><br /><br />This, of course, comes at that lovely time of the year when the industry calls for more security.  It&#8217;s an annual ritual: <a href=\"http://rss.com.com/2100-1009-997404.html?type=pt&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=news\">sweeping</a> <a href=\"http://rss.com.com/2100-1009-997231.html?tag=nl\">calls for action</a> within the security industry at the <a href=\"http://www.rsasecurity.com/conference/conf2003_portal.html\">professional conferences</a>, and then drunken indulgence on the company/taxpayer dime with the very folks they&#8217;re supposed to be &#8220;fighting&#8221; when <a href=\"http://www.defcon.org\">DefCon</a> rolls around.  It&#8217;s ugly, it&#8217;s wrong, and it isn&#8217;t getting things more secure.  Projects like OpenBSD, that historically have put quality work and methodical testing before commercial flash and even social pleasantries, actually get things more secure.  If <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">DARPA</span></span></span></span> cared more about security than politics they&#8217;d be putting their money where Theo de Raadt&#8217;s loud mouth is.  Love him or hate him (and most people hate him), the man gets the job done.  And that&#8217;s what the government, and the security industry, could use for a change: a job well done.  <b><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">UPDATE</span></span></span></span>:</b> The Register weighs in with <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/30333.html\">a story on the pulled funding</a> and a superb <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/30332.html\">opinion piece</a> reccomending a &#8220;harm reduction&#8221; approach to stopping crackers, which mentions OpenBSD explicitly.</p>"<br />
