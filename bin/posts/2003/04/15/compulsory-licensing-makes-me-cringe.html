<h1>Compulsory Licensing Makes Me Cringe</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.eff.org\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">EFF</span></span></span></span></a>&#8217;s Fred von Lohmann suggests in a <a href=\"http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2003/04/14/opinion/7930.shtml\">Daily Princetonian editorial</a> that a compulsory license is a good solution to the peer-to-peer piracy problem.  Sorry Fred, you know I love you <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">EFF</span></span></span></span> kids (and the <a href=\"http://www.eff.org/IP/DMCA/states/200304_sdmca_eff_analysis.php\">super-DMCA analysis</a> is superb), but you missed the boat on this one.  There are a bunch of problems with compulsory licensing, which is generally conceived as a flat fee on Internet access that gets passed on to artists via some mechanism.  Of course, making sure the right people get compensated in proportion means doing what the <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">RIAA</span></span></span></span> does now: policing file-sharing services.  And, as is rarely discussed when people bring this issue up, how are independent musicians who have no <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">RIAA</span></span></span></span> representation remunerated?  What if the artists <i>want</i> people to be sharing their music for free?  And, more important than all of the music world concerns, what about those Internet users who don&#8217;t ever touch file-sharing?  I see no reason why my father, who uses the Net solely for email and browsing, should be penalized for people like me who make the occasional illegitimate download (along with a bunch of <a href=\"http://www.emusic.com\">legitimate ones</a>).  And don&#8217;t give me any lines about this being a sort of tax for &#8220;netizens&#8221;: for most of the world, the Internet is a service, a means to various ends, <strong>not</strong> a community or society.  It seems a task too technically and politically complex to regard as a good solution.  Let&#8217;s keep thinking, folks.</p>"<br />
