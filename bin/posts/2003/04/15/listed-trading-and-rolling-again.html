<h1>Listed, Trading, and Rolling (Again)</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Got myself all registered and, soon, <a href=\"http://www.blogshares.com/blogs.php?blog=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.al3x.net%2F\">indexed</a> on BlogShares.  It&#8217;s a neat idea: a stock market for weblogs, where the worth of each blog is determined by how many people link to it and how much those linkers are worth.  Obviously this site here <a href=\"http://www.blogshares.com/blogs.php?blog=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.al3x.net%2F\">isn&#8217;t worth much</a> yet.  You famous bloggers need to either link me or buy some shares.  Preferably both.  I&#8217;ve already bought shares in some of my favorite reads.  Unrelated: the blogroll has been updated.  Some stuff dropped, a bunch of stuff added.  I use a slightly tweaked version of <a href=\"http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/000386.html\">Jeremy Zawodny&#8217;s opml2html</a> perl script to convert my exported list of NetNewsWire feeds to a bunch of <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">HTML</span></span></span></span> list items I can slap right into my blog template.</p>"<br />
