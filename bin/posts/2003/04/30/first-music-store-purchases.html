<h1>First Music Store Purchases</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>After a couple days of unsucessful attempts to register my credit card with Apple, their Musc Store finally cooperated this morning.  I can&#8217;t blame them &#8211; ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; worse than trying to get financial systems to talk to, well, anything else, much less handle presumably a whole frickin&#8217; bunch of transactions per second.  But now it works like a charm, and I bought two songs to test it out: &#8220;The Big Country&#8221; by Talking Heads and &#8220;Sweet Jane (Live)&#8221; by The Velvet Underground.  As I mentioned, there&#8217;s not a lot of stuff for my odd musical palette up there (yet?), but there are a few old tracks like these that I&#8217;ve wanted a clean copy of.  The downloads were absurdly fast, maybe 20 seconds on the campus connection, the iTunes integration &#8220;just worked,&#8221; and sound quality is excellent.  Worth $0.99/song?  Hell yes.  Giving up on <a href=\"http://www.emusic.com\">Emusic</a>?  Hell no, not until Apple has at least as good a selection of small labels, which doesn&#8217;t look to be their focus at all.  Still, the Music Store is reccomended.</p>"<br />
