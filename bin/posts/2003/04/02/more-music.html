<h1>More Music</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Trying to make up for the lack of music posts I guess.  Listen to &#8220;69 Love Songs&#8221; by <a href="http://www.houseoftomorrow.com/tmf.php">The Magnetic Fields</a> if you&#8217;ve ever tuned into your local public radio station when they&#8217;re playing <i>really</i> old country music and kinda dug it.  Rich vocals, sweet nothing verses, and banjos.  Makes me happy&#8230;</p><br />
