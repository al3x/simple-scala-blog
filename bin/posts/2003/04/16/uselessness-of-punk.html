<h1>The Uselessness of Punk</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Right now I&#8217;ve got a &#8220;hardcore&#8221; punk band blaring into my dorm room window, forcibly, as part of a weekly early-evening concert series on my residence hall&#8217;s quad.  It&#8217;s pretty rare that I listen to punk, since my taste in the genre runs towards the amusing, original, and genuine bands like the Sex Pistols and the Dead Kennedys.  I&#8217;m skeptical of music, really most art, that&#8217;s made for ideological purposes.  It&#8217;s nice to have utility in art, but nobody seems to understand the subtle utility of centuries gone by.  So, while the Pistols and Kennedys may have had some venting to do about mainstream culture and urban decay, they also had genuinely good, aesthetically pleasing music.  Contrast that with the endless, pathetically derivative punk bands that followed and you understand why most of those acts never even seen the dirty coattails of a critic&#8217;s pick list.  There&#8217;s nothing sadder, or more useless, than a modern punk band.  It&#8217;s a contradiction in terms: the punk movement was localized to a time period of economic and ideological distress and shifts in the rock &#8216;n roll aesthetic.  Trying to recreate all that misses the point: punk was shocking, obnoxious, self-consciously offensive, and wholly temporary.  I&#8217;m guessing the godfathers of punk would be indignant at the idea of bands, more than twenty years hence, trying to convey punk ideals by <em>exactly the same means</em>, musical and otherwise.  Nothing&#8217;s shocking.. for very long.  But, on the counter-argument, I can see how people who enjoy the sound of punk appreciate new bands for their musicality.  There&#8217;s plenty of reasons to undermine an ideology, but few to undermine taste.</p>"<br />
