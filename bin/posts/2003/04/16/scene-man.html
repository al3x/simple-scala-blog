<h1>The Scene, Man</h1>
--- <br />- <p>The experimental electronic music scene around DC/MD/VA owes a lot to a select few.  I had the privledge of meeting Derek Morton, definitely select amongst the few, and member of longtime personal favorite local act <a href="http://www.mikroknytes.com/">Microknytes</a>.  Turns out he&#8217;s putting together a <a href="http://www.mikroknytes.com/techclub/">series of happenings</a>, if you&#8217;ll excuse the term, that are sort of themed &#8220;open amp nights&#8221; for local experimentalists.  The first, &#8220;Open Minijax,&#8221; is strictly for performances involving portable audio devices that have a minijack (1/8&#8221; headphone) output.  I&#8217;m gonna go represent the iBook contingent.  Good timing, too, as two days later the label cohorts and I will be truckin&#8217; on up to <a href="http://www.mutek.ca/">Mutek</a> in Montreal.  For more immediate experimental gratification, check out Baltimore&#8217;s own <a href="http://www.oncetwicesound.com/festival/">Once.Twice Festival</a> this Thursday through Sunday.  I&#8217;ll be at all of it, barring disaster.</p><br />
