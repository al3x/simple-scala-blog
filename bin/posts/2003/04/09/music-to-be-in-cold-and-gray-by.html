<h1>Music to Be In The Cold and Gray By</h1>
--- <br />- <p>It&#8217;s been college busy.  Busy and cold.  Cold and wet.  And for such days, when your head and eyes ache from the paper-n-computer work that isn&#8217;t physically taxing but we kvetch about it no end anyway, you don&#8217;t want to listen to cerebral electronic music at the end of the day.  Maybe weather and work are turning me into a rocker.  Maybe I just like this music more than I&#8217;ve let myself agree I do.  But the dulcet Scottish tones of <a href="http://www.arabstrap.co.uk/">Arab Strap</a> aren&#8217;t ceasing to please me, nor is Jeff (Neutral Milk Hotel) Mangum&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/m/mangum_jeff/live-at-jittery-joes.shtml">live album</a>.  It&#8217;s not so much that it&#8217;s gloomy music for gloomy weather, because it&#8217;s not really (the music that is; the weather is shite).  It&#8217;s that both artists practice the sort of metasongwriting that seems to be the only form of sung music I enjoy these days.  Their lyrics are just on a different plane, looking down on the experiences they write about with an eerie insight.  That, and the music is awful pretty.</p><br />
