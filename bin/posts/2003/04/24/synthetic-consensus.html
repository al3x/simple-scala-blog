<h1>Synthetic Consensus?</h1>
--- <br />- "<p><a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/\">The Register</a>&#8217;s Andrew Orlowski can be an asshole, and he was in high form when he wrote <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/30367.html\">this criticism</a> of the unfolding <a href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/et2003/\">O&#8217;Reilly Emerging Technology Conference</a> (which I wish I was attending).  The big man himself, Tim O&#8217;Reilly, took the time out to <a href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3100\">dismiss</a> this piece as both a flame and fluffy journalism, which it most certainly is.  But, as with most provocateurs, Orlowski has a point somewhere in his heap of snarky prose.<br /><br /><br /><br />ETCon may not be as evil as Orlowski makes it out to be, but there&#8217;s something to be said for his assertion that &#8220;it&#8217;s hard to imagine that this won&#8217;t break down into a consensual circle-jerk.&#8221;  Or rather that the conference was from the start, as he puts it, akin to the &#8220;world of blogdom [where many of the organizers and speakers hang out], which relies heavily on its own, synthetic consensus.&#8221;  When you get lots of smart, like-minded people in once place, like ETCon, two things tend to happen: people have lots of neat ideas, and most of those ideas go uncriticized.  Call it the nature of conferences, but who&#8217;s going to pay $1000+ just to attend and dissent?  Of course, the worthwhile ideas that make it out of the conference will then be up for jabs, so perhaps things balance out.  All I know is that for a bunch of networked geeks, the <a href=\"http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/top100.html\">blog clique</a> sure likes hanging out in person.  Does that get more good thinking done, or just a lot of backslapping?</p>"<br />
