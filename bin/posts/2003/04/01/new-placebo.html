<h1>New Placebo</h1>
--- <br />- <p>One of the few guitar-driven bands I enjoy, <a href="http://www.placeboworld.co.uk">Placebo</a>, has a new album out.  It appears to rock out, as with their previous material, in the vein of The Smiths, Depeche Mode, The Cure, and other angsty-but-fun &#8216;80s alternative regulars.  Now if only they would tour here again&#8230;</p><br />
