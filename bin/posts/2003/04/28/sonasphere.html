<h1>Sonasphere</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Nao Tokui&#8217;s <a href="http://www.dropcontrol.com/~naotokui/sonasphere/">Sonasphere</a> software is insanely great.  Position audio and effects as spheres in 3D space, then rock some physics on said spheres.  You can then hear the &#8220;collisions&#8221; and so forth.  Endless potential.  Hats off, Mr. Tokui.</p><br />
