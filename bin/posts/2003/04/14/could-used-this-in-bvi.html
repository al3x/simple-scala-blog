<h1>Could&#8217;ve Used This in BVI</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>As found on <a href=\"http://boingboing.net/#200145226\">BoingBoing</a>: &#8220;Casio Japan has <a href=\"http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/urltrurl?lp=ja_en&amp;url=http://www.casio.co.jp/release/2003/ex_ws2.html\">released</a> a waterproof external case for its Exilim [digital] cameras.&#8221;  I&#8217;m loving my EX-S2, for which I recently tracked down a leather case from a Japanese eBayer, as cases are utterly unavailable in the US.  I&#8217;m no Ansel Adams (nor, disappointingly, even a <a href=\"http://www.toonopedia.com/addams.htm\">Charles Addams</a>), but this camera has served me well for snapshots and small movies over the past few weeks.  I hadn&#8217;t exactly been planning on carrying a camera everywhere and snapping whatever I found interesting, but the tiny size of the Exilim lets you keep it in a pocket and forget about it until you come across a scene of overwhelming everyday &#8220;American Beauty&#8221;-style beauty.  Which, if your standards are as a low a paper bag blowing about in the wind, happens about sixteen times a day.  But, back to the point, I really could&#8217;ve used an underwater digital camera in the British Virgin Islands this past winter break.  I saw some lovely fish that I just know would&#8217;ve been happier knowing their portraits were captured in two megapixel glory.</p>"<br />
