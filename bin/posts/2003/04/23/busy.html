<h1>Busy</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>With one C program (that translates arbitrary textfiles into Morse code) down and about eight hojillion papers to write, things are looking about as bright as a Baghdad morning.  Nah, I kid.  It&#8217;s nice to have so many engaging assignments, but it&#8217;s a bear when they all converge at once.  This summer I intend to get to all those things I just haven&#8217;t had enough hours in the day for: music, more in-depth blogging, building a laser death cannon .. uh, forget you heard that last one.  Summer&#8217;s gonna be nice, is all.</p>"<br />
