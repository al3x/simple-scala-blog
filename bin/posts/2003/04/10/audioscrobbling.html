--- <br />- <p><a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.com/">Audioscrobbler</a> &#8220;aims to be your personal music advisor.&#8221;  You run a plugin or some such bit of software that sends the MP3s you&#8217;re playing to the Audioscrobbler site.  After you&#8217;ve played 500 songs the site starts to recommend new music for you to dig based on who else is listening to the things you listen to.  I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=top10&amp;file=userinfo&amp;user=al3x">still working</a> on those 500 songs, but I think it&#8217;s a nice idea.  Like the Amazon.com recommendation system only more so.  Get hooked up on their site.</p><br />
