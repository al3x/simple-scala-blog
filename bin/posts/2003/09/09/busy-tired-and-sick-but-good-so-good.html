<h1>Busy Tired and Sick But Good So Good</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>It&#8217;s been a busy, sleepless weekend of geekdom, parties, the semesterly <a href=\"http://userpages.umbc.edu/~randy/umbc-installfest/Fall2003/index.html\">Linux Installfest</a>, and learning how to have (male) friends again.  I haven&#8217;t written, haven&#8217;t felt like writing, and really don&#8217;t have anything much to write now.  I&#8217;ll explain away my absences if I damn well please.  Oh, add pining to the list of activities.  It&#8217;s not as bad when I keep myself busy, but if I stop for a minute I think of her.  So I&#8217;ve kept myself going and now I&#8217;m a little sick.<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#8217;ve decided that I would like a girl who will, amongst other things, make love with me while the new Deftones album plays, particularly <a href=\"http://www.thedeftones.com/deftoneslyrics.shtml#luckyou\">Lucky You</a>.  I was skeptical myself, but it&#8217;s a damn fine album.  But the issue at hand:  any takers?  I need a sacrifice, or you&#8217;ll never get anything but personal posts again.</p>"<br />
