<h1>Machine Nomenclature</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Geeks name their machines like sailors name their ships and gearheads name their cars.  I&#8217;ve used Japanese words as names for my computers ever since I had machines that were mine to name.  Despite knowing only a smidgen of Japanese, I have a fair bit of faith in the translated accuracy of the words I picked, as (like my Kanji tattoo) they came from respectable academic translation databases.<br /><br /><br /><br />The <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_performa/stats/mac_performa_575.html">Performa 575</a> I cut my computational teeth on shared my old handle of &#8216;tensai,&#8217; which means &#8216;natural disaster&#8217; but is also, to the best of my knowledge, the phonetic pronunciation of &#8216;prodigy/genius.&#8217;  My old <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/9111/ibmtp760/thinkpad.html">brick of a ThinkPad</a> was called &#8216;tenshi kuro,&#8217; meaning &#8216;black angel.&#8217;  The OpenBSD server that once gave the world the now-defunct hyouden.net (and this very site for a time) was, in kind, &#8216;hyouden,&#8217; meaning &#8216;field of infinite/endless snow.&#8217;  My last desktop was &#8216;tenshu,&#8217; meaning &#8216;Lord of Heaven/God&#8217; (that machine was fucking <em>fast</em>).  The computer I mostly gave to my ex, which she later quite sensibly sold off in parts to fund an iBook, was called &#8216;okurimono,&#8217; meaning &#8216;gift.&#8217;  I forget the names of the PowerBook G4 (something about metal) and Fujitsu I had briefly, but I assure you they were Japanese.<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#8217;ve had my current and sole machine for nearly a year now and have never named it for no good reason.  Today I decided to call it &#8216;koyuki,&#8217; meaning &#8216;light snow.&#8217;  Being a 12&#8221; iBook as it is I think the name is pretty self-evident.</p><br />
