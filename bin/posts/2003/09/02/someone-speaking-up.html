<h1>Someone&#8217;s Speaking Up</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Remember that $90 million Microsoft purchase by Homeland Security I <a href="http://www.al3x.net/mt/archives/000213.html">wrote about</a> a while back?  At least Ed Black, President and <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CEO</span></span></span> of the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, has the nerve to <a href="http://www.ccianet.org/letters/dhs_030827.pdf">speak up</a> to Tom Ridge about it in the wake of endless worm-based demonstrations of fundamental insecurity in Microsoft software.  It\&#8217;s a nice gesture, but it won\&#8217;t reverse that purchase order.</p><br />
