<h1>Lil&#8217; Ol&#8217; Me Speaking At ToorCon</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>I&#8217;m not sure how exactly this escaped posting until now, but it has, so time to rectify that: I&#8217;m speaking at <a href=\"http://www.toorcon.org/\">ToorCoon 2003</a> in a matter of days (<em>ulp!</em>).  My contribution, with psuedo-former Tangerine associate Phil Leif, is to the <a href=\"http://www.toorcon.org/details.html?id=11\">&#8220;Securing Wireless&#8221;</a> panel, on which I&#8217;ll be talking about deploying <a href=\"http://www.soekris.com/\">Soekris</a> embedded systems running a custom distribution of <a href=\"http://www.openbsd.org/\">OpenBSD</a> for &#8220;openly secure&#8221; public 802.11b wireless access points.  Phil will talk about some of the business and logistical considerations of running public wireless networks, and we&#8217;ll then join our associates on the panel to answer questions about, well, securing wireless.  It&#8217;s gonna be the hot joint.<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#8217;ve been eager to get out to ToorCon for several years, and I&#8217;m thrilled that I not only get to see the con, but speak at it.  In my eyes the convention falls somewhere between <a href=\"http://www.summercon.org/\">SummerCon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.defcon.org/\">DefCon</a>: a security conference that&#8217;s not overwhelmingly large, and has hands in both the professional InfoSec world and the &#8220;hacker underground,&#8221; such as it is these days.  I guess I&#8217;ll find if my suspicions are confirmed later this month.  I&#8217;m awful excited.  And I get to escape DC weather for sunny San Diego!  Or at least for a dark hotel in sunny San Diego.<br /><br /><br /><br />So am I &#8220;l33t&#8221; yet?  ;-)</p>"<br />
