<h1>New Head of Homeland Cybersecurity</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Yup, <a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/09/15/HNczar_1.html\">new sherif in town</a>.  The new G-man in question is one Amit Yoran, founder of Alexandria, VA information security house RipTech Inc.<br /><br /><br /><br />I actually interviewed for an internship there before they got bought up by <a href=\"http://www.riptech.com/\">Symantec</a>.  They didn&#8217;t have the budget or staff flexibility at the time, which was a shame &#8216;cause it was one sweet shop: biometrics on the doors, badass workstations for their intrusion analysts, killer labs, warroom-style central command area, etc.  I never met Yoran, big bossman that he was, but their other RipTech folks seemed pleasant and competent.  Let&#8217;s hope he set that mold, and that he won&#8217;t go handing out contracts to Symantec left and right.</p>"<br />
