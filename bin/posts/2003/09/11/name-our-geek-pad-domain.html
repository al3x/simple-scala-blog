<h1>Name Our Geek Pad Domain</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Being more social this year at school, while not without its detriments to my health <em>sniffle cough sneeze</em>, has been thusfar rewarding.  I&#8217;m lucky to have made the fast friendship of <a href=\"http://userpages.umbc.edu/<sub>scottr1/index.html&#8221;&gt;this cat</a>, who if you can look past his miserable site design and casual spelling errors is in fact a great guy ;-)  We quickly realized that the sheer number of common interests and experiences between us meant we either had to join forces or fight to the death, superhero doppelganger-style.  Noting the years of martial arts experience on his <a href=\"http://userpages.umbc.edu/</sub>scottr1/resume.htm&#8221;&gt;resume</a> I chose the previous option, and our powers are now combined in the name of justice.  Or at least in the name of smoking cigars and hacking up <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">POSIX</span></span></span> operating systems.<br /><br /><br /><br />So this cat, Scott, has got a fine little fixer-upper just about five minutes off campus.  While I&#8217;m quite comfortable in my shiny new on-campus apartment, having even a modest <em>house</em> is an appealing prospect for the final two years of my college experience.  Clearly between the two of us it would be one helluva geek pad: mad server racks, serious storage, wired and wireless networking, a firewall/router like you wouldn&#8217;t believe, wine cellar and humidor hooked up to electronic stock monitoring, etc etc.  Such a setup is undeniably deserving of a good domain name for all those networked machines.<br /><br /><br /><br />So here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking: you suggest amusing, interesting, efficient, or otherwise good domain names for our geek pad that aren&#8217;t already taken.  Points for ones that make for amusing subdomains (of the form <em>machine.funnyname.domain</em>).  If you pick the winning domain you get the grand, personal tour of our <em>casa de dork</em>, and probably dinner. Or maybe a shell account on Scott&#8217;s SparcStation LX.  Whatever.  It&#8217;ll be great.<br /><br /><br /><br />Let&#8217;s see those domains.</p>"<br />
