<h1>From Partly Cloudy San Diego</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Uneventful flights over to the Left Coat, now presently hanging out in a Starbucks (they have them here, you&#8217;ll love them), sipping a Jamba Juice (ditto), surfing this &#8220;wireless Interweb&#8221; I keep hearing so much about.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sorry for not writing more but school and <a href="http://www.toorcon.org/">conference</a> prep have kept me mad busy.  When people Google me during my talk tomorrow and find this site (a search for &#8220;Alexander Payne&#8221; produces this site before the director of my same name) they&#8217;re gonna think I&#8217;m some sorry emo LiveJournal kid from the past few posts.  But by pointing this out I&#8217;ve theoretically staved off any blog-related heckles from conference attendees (save, I&#8217;m told firsthand, from my co-presenter <a href="http://www.timeporn.net/">Phil)</a>.<br /><br /><br /><br />So yeah, all seems go for the talk except for some Compact Flash media that&#8217;s freaking out on me.  If anyone knows of a good computer shop in downtown San Diego it&#8217;d be pretty nice of you to hit me up on <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">AIM</span></span></span> or email before, say, 7pm <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">PST</span></span></span>.</p><br />
