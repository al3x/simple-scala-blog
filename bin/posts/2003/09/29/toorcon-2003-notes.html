--- <br />- <p>I&#8217;ll write more about the con when I&#8217;m home tomorrow, but now that I&#8217;ve got mad net connectivity here at <a href="http://www.dachb0den.com/">Dachb0den</a> it seems a good time to share the collaborative notes on the conference that I and several other Rendezvous-enabled attendees took.  So right here, exclusive, and in plain old readable <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">ASCII</span></span></span>, are:<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.al3x.net/toorcon2003day1.txt">Day One</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.al3x.net/toorcon2003day2.txt">Day Two</a><br /><br /><br /><br />We got quite a few of the talks and took some pretty damn good notes.  Read, learn, wish you had been there.  Sucka.</p><br />
