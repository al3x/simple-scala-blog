<h1>Spam Cocktail</h1>
--- <br />- |<br />  <p>A while back I <a href="http://www.al3x.net/mt/archives/000042.html">linked</a> to a handful of cocktail recipe sites that I came across in my search for good Painkiller proportions.  One of them was mixed-drink.com, a fine enough site but hardly a boozer&#8217;s digital paradise.  I&#8217;ve thought little of it until this afternoon, when I received this email:</p><br /><br /><br />- |<br />  <blockquote><tt><br />Hello:<br /><br /><br /><br />I noticed that you linked to mixed-drink.com from your website. I thought that you might be very interested in a website my company just developed called BarTV.com which features cocktail recipes, bartending tips and tricks as well as articles about cocktail culture. When you get a chance, please visit the site and consider linking to it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.bartv.com">http://www.bartv.com</a> &#8211; dedicated to liquid.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Bill Litfin<br /></tt></blockquote><br /><br /><br />- "<p>Clearly, Mr. Litfin, I have no problem at all with linking your site.  In fact, your site is so good that I&#8217;ll overlook what was, essentially, unsolicited commercial email and flat out <em>recommend</em> your site.  Sloshy readers: this is a damn fine site for all things cocktail.  It is well designed (despite using Flash), stylish, and chock full of lush-favorable content.  My <a href=\"http://www.acesulfamek.com\">associates</a> and I deem it good.  Drink up.</p>"<br />
