<h1>Enh, Forget It</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I&#8217;m going to take a cue from the <a href="http://www.5dots.net/">big 5</a> and not bother with this whole silly lyrical mix thing.  It&#8217;s like half past getting-the-fuck-over-it o&#8217;clock as it is.  No need to make y&#8217;all suffer through a bunch of lyrics you won&#8217;t read in full anyway.  And I think all the stuff I&#8217;ve been listening to has been blogged here before.  Consider yourselves spared.</p><br />
