<h1>A Heartbroken al3x Presents&#8230;</h1>
--- <br />- <p>...a lyrical mix in text format spanning several days and multiple blog entries.  In true sad emo fuck should-be-Livejournaling-this fashion I&#8217;m going to post the lyrics to the songs that are(n&#8217;t really very well) getting me through leaving the girl I desperately love(d).  Yes, that was like months ago, regular readers.  It&#8217;s just sinking in.  Fuck off.<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#8217;m also really busy with pre-ToorCon stuff, so this makes it seem like I&#8217;ve got content.  Psych!  You totally fell for it, sucka.<br /><br /><br /><br />The mix starts now.</p><br />
