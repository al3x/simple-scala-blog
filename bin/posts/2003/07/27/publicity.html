<h1>Publicity</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>The company I&#8217;m working for this summer, <a href=\"http://www.sliceoftangerine.net/\">Tangerine Unwired</a>, got yet more <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A51285-2003Jul26.html\">publicity</a> in the Washington Post today, tucked into a side-article for a feature on wireless (in)security.  The <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A51284-2003Jul26.html\">feature article itself</a> is pretty two years ago: wardriving, <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">WEP</span></span></span></span> doesn&#8217;t work, potential for &#8220;massive virus attacks over wireless in airports,&#8221; the sort of crap that reporters just seem to eat up.  I&#8217;m tempted to write their editors and suggest a different perspective on wireless security: that, just like on a wired connection, if your packet-level traffic isn&#8217;t strongly encrypted  (think <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">SSL</span></span></span></span>, not <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">WEP</span></span></span></span>), you might was well just give hardcopies of your data away.  And while that&#8217;s a suitably sexy doom-n-gloom tech story, the reality is that most important data is already encrypted, and you just don&#8217;t know it (or, apparently, the Post reporters don&#8217;t).<br /><br /><br /><br />I mean, I can sit my iBook down with a packet sniffer in any computer lab on any university campus and grab most of the mundane traffic: <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">AIM</span></span></span></span> conversations, <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">IRC</span></span></span></span> sessions, the unencrypted web pages people are browsing, etc.  But what I can&#8217;t see is the important stuff, the stuff most web sites sensibly put behind an <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">HTTPS</span></span></span></span> connection: e-commerce sessions, secure webmail, people checking their bank balances, logins to many online content providers, etc.  Like I said above: most important data, regardless of how you connect to the Internet, is already well-encrypted from your browser to the destination server with no extra hassle.  Unless you&#8217;re really worried about that other guy with the laptop in Starbucks knowing you obsessively read The Drudge Report, why encrypt everything?  There&#8217;s no good reason to expect security in the communications layer (WiFi, ethernet) when it&#8217;s more robustly and efficiently provided in the transportation layer (IPSec, <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">SSL</span></span></span></span>-based <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">HTTPS</span></span></span></span>).  And isn&#8217;t the whole point of having wireless everywhere that you can just jump on a network and do your thing, no questions or passwords asked?<br /><br /><br /><br />Frustrating.  But, to retract an earlier statement, I am in fact doing wireless stuff for Tangerine.  Wireless <em>security</em> stuff.  Wireless security stuff I can&#8217;t talk about.  Heh heh heh&#8230;   <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">UPDATED</span></span></span></span>: Boing Boing <a href=\"http://boingboing.net/2003_07_01_archive.html#200443794\">criticizes</a> the article as well, and Wi-Fi Networking News <a href=\"http://wifinetnews.com/archives/002005.html\">takes it from there</a>.</p>"<br />
