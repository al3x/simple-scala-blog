<h1>Note To Y&#8217;all</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Stole that cat&#8217;s design ;<del>)  A few tweaks here and there, but the essential clean all-CSS look is the same.  I&#8217;m now grafting it on to the archives.  The color scheme, by the way, is my favorite mix of blues and grays that a friend of mine calls the &#8220;sad cloud&#8221; palate.  I&#8217;ve used it for years on my various sites and it never ceases to please (me).<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPDATED</span></span></span>:</strong> All done!  Enjoy the new look, and thanks again to Matthew Rothenberg for his lovely layout.  Hopefully he&#8217;ll update his blog sometime soon&#8230; with a post about people ripping him off ;</del>)</p><br />
