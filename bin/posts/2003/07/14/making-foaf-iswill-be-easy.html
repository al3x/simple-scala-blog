<h1>Making FOAF Is/Will Be Easy</h1>
--- <br />- <p>So say you wanna get on this whole <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">FOAF</span></span></span></span> thing, to &#8220;ride da <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">FOAF</span></span></span></span> donkey,&#8221; as it were.  Right now there&#8217;s the web form-based <a href="http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic.html"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">FOAF</span></span></span></span>-a-matic</a>, and that&#8217;s not a bad solution.  But pretty soon there&#8217;s gonna be <a href="http://danhon.com/ec/mtarchives/000573.shtml#000573">HandShake</a> for Mac <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span></span></span>, an easy to use desktop app for viewing and editing <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">FOAF</span></span></span></span> files that can also graph your network of friends.  And that will be hella cool.<br /><br /><br /><br />Where am I getting all these k-rad <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">FOAF</span></span></span></span> links, you ask?  Why, from the <a href="http://rdfweb.org/">RDFWeb <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">FOAF</span></span></span></span> Project blog</a>, of course.  I wouldn&#8217;t look too closely or you&#8217;ll realize how shamelessly I&#8217;ve been yoinking their content.<br /><br /><br /><br />Oh yeah, and I&#8217;ve got <a href="http://www.al3x.net/foaf.rdf">my own <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">FOAF</span></span></span></span> file</a> up, too (see a respectable <a href="http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/explorer/?foaf=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.al3x.net%2Ffoaf.rdf">FoaF Explorer view</a> of it).  I hope you&#8217;re allowed to refer to people you&#8217;ve only met in a fairly cursory fashion as &#8220;friends&#8221; for community-building purposes.  If not, the social software gestapo (which surely exists) will be on my ass in like 10 minutes.</p><br />
