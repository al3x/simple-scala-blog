<h1>Meeting People Is Easy (2)</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Or, more accurately, sites by which one can meet people are easy to use.  I&#8217;ve got embarrassingly formulaic profiles up on a couple of dating sites; scan the competition and you realize that young geeky hipsters are a dime a dozen.  Fortunately, I&#8217;m faster, stronger, lacking in unnecessary wind resistance, and in compliance with a variety of international standards for maximum interoperability, all of which my peers cannot accurately claim.  I&#8217;d say my prospects are good.  But then, I&#8217;m full of shit.<br /><br /><br /><br />I did take the <a href="http://www.friendster.com/">Friendster</a> plunge in this frenzy of dating site prostitution, so if you&#8217;d like to be validated as &#8220;my friend,&#8221; or vice versa, feel free.  If they published <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-foaf.html"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">FOAF</span></span></span></span></a> I&#8217;d be more impressed, but it&#8217;s still pretty keen.  So now I just sit back and wait for a meaningful, fulfilling relationship to fall into my lap, right?  Great.</p><br />
