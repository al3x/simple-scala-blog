<h1>Verizon&#8217;s First Camera Phone</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Verizon finally has <a href="http://www.prnewswire.u/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=SVBIZINK8.story&amp;STORY=/www/story/07-08-2003/0001977977&amp;EDATE=TUE+Jul+08+2003,+08:45+AM">a camera phone</a>.  It&#8217;s $300 retail; that is, without the 2-year contract extension for existing Verizon customers like yours truly.  That&#8217;s a lot more than the &#8221;$150 after $50 rebate&#8221; price that they&#8217;ll be quoting everywhere, and seems like a pretty penny for a .4 megapixel resolution camera, no matter how good the phone around it is.  I&#8217;ve ditched my previous digicam from lack of use, so having a camera with me would be nice.  But I&#8217;m not sure if this is the way&#8230;</p><br />
