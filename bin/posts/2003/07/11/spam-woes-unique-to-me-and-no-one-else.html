<h1>Spam Woes (Unique to Me And No One Else&#8230;)</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>When we eschew our civil liberties in the face of terror, the terrorists have already won, or so they say.  In that vein I posit that we if modify the content of our emails to avoid spam filters, the spammers have already won.  I don&#8217;t care if <a href=\"http://sexxi.al3x.net\">Sexxi</a> gets picked up by filters; I&#8217;m gonna write about it in my emails, filters be damned.<br /><br /><br /><br />To that end, if filters suck so bad that you still have to comb through a &#8220;spam bucket&#8221; it seems like you might as well not bother.  Well, I refuse to comb through anymore.  I&#8217;m shunting what SpamAssassin tags as the most obvious of spams to /dev/null, never to be seen again.  If your email gets caught in there, tough; IM me or something.  SpamAssassin is pretty good, however: it hasn&#8217;t generated a single false positive in my week of testing, which is more than can be said for Apple&#8217;s learning filters in Mail.app.<br /><br /><br /><br />Still waiting on some viable anti-spam legislation.  US-centric policies will just drive things further offshore.  I like the idea of a bounty, but I think it should be paid only when you have the spammer&#8217;s head in a bag, ready to be dramatically flung down onto the desk of a whiskey-soaked Ol&#8217; West sheriff.  Or maybe just the spammer&#8217;s router.  Whichever.  As long as it&#8217;s in a bag.</p>"<br />
