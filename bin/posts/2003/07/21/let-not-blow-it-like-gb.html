--- <br />- <p>The Observer <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,1001636,00.html?=rss">confirms</a> that bad infrastructure decisions &#8211; like, say, spending a shitload on painfully insecure Microsoft systems &#8211; can undermine public confidence in eGovernment.  Poor support and publicity for these services doesn&#8217;t help the situation much.  We&#8217;re already on the same path to eGov failure that Great Britain has travelled. Do we have to walk it ourselves, or can we learn from others?</p><br />
