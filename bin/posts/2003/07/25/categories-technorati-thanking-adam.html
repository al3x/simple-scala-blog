<h1>Categories, Technorati, Thanking Adam Kalsey</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I&#8217;ve broadened the categories in which I file my posts here to better reflect several of my key interests.  You&#8217;ll now find InfoTech Policy and Information Security categories, separate from the Technology and Politics labels under which those topics previously got placed.  In addition, my moblog now has a category all its own, and despite previous <a href="http://www.al3x.net/mt/archives/000159.html">denouncements</a>, Metablogging (blogging about blogging) is recognized as a necessary byproduct of being interested in the blog scene.  Finally, to separate out Apple-related posts from the rest of my musings on technology a Mac category has been added.  This should keep things neatly filed away, and ideally encourage me write about infotech  and infosec policy more, which I really should given that they&#8217;re pretty much my field of study.<br /><br /><br /><br />In geekier news, it seems whatever problems the Technorati weblog info service was having yesterday have been resolved.  Thanks nonetheless to Adam Kalsey for <a href="http://kalsey.com/2003/07/technorati_fix/">updating</a> his Technorati MT plugin to be that much more fault-tolerant.  Between that and his help on the Related Entries mySQL hack I totally owe that man coffee.  Or liquor.  Or maybe just money.</p><br />
