<h1>Ahead of the Beer Curve</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Dan over at SimpleBits has a <a href="http://www.simplebits.com/200307#1059102352">few clear bullets</a> on why Jamaican export Red Stripe is, well, good.  I got hooked on the stuff when sailing around the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">BVI</span></span></span></span> this past Christmas holiday.  The cheaper local brew there is Carib, but only touristas are caught drinking it &#8211; would you trust beer in a clear glass bottle that sits on a hot dock during shipment?  Red Stripe, on the other hand, is sensibly shipped in squat, dark brown bottles.  It&#8217;s the perfect boat beer, and compliments most light summer meals.  Cheers indeed, Dan.</p><br />
