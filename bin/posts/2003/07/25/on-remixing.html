<h1>On Remixing</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Having bowed out of making my own music, remixing and DJing is pretty much all I do on the audio front.  Which is fine: I like remixing and DJing far better than coming up with my own stuff, in part because molding someone else&#8217;s material into something new and different is a fun challenge, and in part because I&#8217;m lazy.  To that end, <a href=\"http://www.dieselsweeties.com./archive.php?s=737\">today&#8217;s Diesel Sweeties</a> has an amusing take on remixing from the original artist&#8217;s perspective.<br /><br /><br /><br />And yeah, what the hell&#8217;s up with comics not syndicating in <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">RSS</span></span></span></span>/Atom/whatever?  I mean, it&#8217;s not like they need the revenue that comes from ad banners and Cafe Press clothes to finance their astronomical hosting hosts or anything.  <a href=\"http://www.jerkcity.com/\">Jerks</a>.</p>"<br />
