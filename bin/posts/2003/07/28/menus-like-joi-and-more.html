<h1>Menus Like Joi? And More</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I was doing Dynamic <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTML</span></span></span></span> back in the fucking <em>day</em>.  Seriously.  But by and large having things zooming all about your web pages courtesy of <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CSS</span></span></span></span> and JavaScript didn&#8217;t prove too useful, and it died off as being terribly 1996, at least in my book.  That&#8217;s why I was pleasantly surprised at the new layout of <a href="http://joi.ito.com/">Joi&#8217;s site</a>, which hides the usual massive list of blog extras in some simple, elegant drop-down menus.  Should I look into something like this for my site&#8217;s redesign?  Or do y&#8217;all enjoy the huge list o&#8217; details and blogroll and such?<br /><br /><br /><br />Also, the Related Entries stuff doesn&#8217;t seem to be working too well. My <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">SQL</span></span></span></span> queries are pretty lenient, but nonetheless I hardly seem to get any results at all.  Worth keeping around?  And sorry <a href="http://biogeek04.tripod.com/">Allan</a>, but those moblog posts are going right in the blog. Smack in that sucker.  But there won&#8217;t be many, &#8216;cause I&#8217;m picky and interesting things don&#8217;t happen in front of me very often.</p><br />
