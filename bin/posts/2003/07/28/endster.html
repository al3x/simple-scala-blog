<h1>Endster</h1>
--- <br />- <p>A big apology to everyone I roped into signing up for Friendster, &#8216;cause I just nixed my account.  Can&#8217;t take the people, oy, the people&#8230;  I&#8217;ve ranted on &#8216;em before, but looking through the Gallery is just too depressing.  It sure won&#8217;t be worth paying for once they leave beta, so I&#8217;m getting out now.  Phew&#8230;</p><br />
