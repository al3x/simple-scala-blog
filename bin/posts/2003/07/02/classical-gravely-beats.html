<h1>Classical Gravely Beats</h1>
--- <br />- <p>That infectious classical music infused with house beats that you keep hearing, both alongside The Matrix and numerous commercials, is the responsibility of one <a href="http://www.rob-dougan.com/">Rob Dougan</a>.  He&#8217;s got a whole album&#8217;s worth of the stuff, &#8220;Furious Angels,&#8221; and many of its standout tracks are laced with his gravely vocals, sounding somewhere between Tom Waits and Peter Gabriel.  It&#8217;s classical, electronic, and pop all at the same time, and far more interesting in amalgam than the component parts typically are.  The album just made its US debut, but the rest of the world, as usual, has had this lovely stuff for years.  Make up for time lost with this elegant and thoughtfully crafted album.</p><br />
