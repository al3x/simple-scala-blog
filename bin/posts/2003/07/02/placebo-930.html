<h1>Placebo @ 9:30</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Just got back from seeing Brit neo-glam/new wave-rs <a href=\"http://www.placeboworld.co.uk/\">Placebo</a> at DC instituion <a href=\"http://www.930.com\">the 9:30 Club</a>.  They attracted a large crowd of angry goth kids, fashionable and unfashionable alterna-sexuals, and a smattering of disappointingly normal but loyal fans like myself.  Ranging from old favorites, often reworked, and new numbers off the album they&#8217;re touring to support, &#8220;Sleeping With Ghosts,&#8221; their set ran at least a good hour.  This was the first date of the US leg of their tour and the band seemed energetic and well-rehearsed. Androgynous lead singer Brian Malko tossed off a few biting song introductions and blew off calls from the crowd: &#8220;Touch me, I&#8217;m sick!&#8221; someone shouted, to which Malko responded a curt &#8220;I&#8217;ll pass&#8221; before launching into another song.  Their new material is superb, and while the single <a href=\"http://www.placeboworld.co.uk/discography/singles4.html\">&#8220;This Picture&#8221;</a> is catchy, &#8220;English Summer Rain&#8221; stood out amongst the new stuff.  While they didn&#8217;t get to my back catalogue favorite &#8220;Brick Shithouse,&#8221; the band did close with an enthusiastic cover of The Pixies&#8217; &#8220;Where Is My Mind?,&#8221; proving that they not only know their musical roots, but can bring something new to the crowded field of alt-rock.  Worth the second-hand smoke and inevitable hearing loss.</p>"<br />
