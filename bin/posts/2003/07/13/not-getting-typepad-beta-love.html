<h1>Not Getting TypePad Beta Love</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>But geez Anil, you didn&#8217;t have to <a href=\"http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?archives/006677.php\">be a dick about it</a> ;-)<br /><br /><br /><br />Seriously though, those Six Apart cats are doing some seriously cool stuff with TypePad, including generating <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">FOAF</span></span></span></span> files for all TypePad users; that&#8217;s the first ever large base of <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">FOAF</span></span></span></span> files pretty much ever.  This could mean great things for interoperability and social connections between the hip &#8220;everybloggers&#8221; who&#8217;ll be using TypePad and the hardcore folks we expect to use <a href=\"http://sexxi.al3x.net/\">Sexxi</a>.  Is Sexxi competition for TypePad?  Hell no: we&#8217;re not hosted, we don&#8217;t have Six Apart&#8217;s experience and resources, and we just aren&#8217;t that cool.  Is it competition for the install-it-yourself Moveable Type?  Maybe, but only for the breed of personal user who likely isn&#8217;t paying for MT anyway.   But as for my general impressions of TypePad gleaned through screenshots and word of mouth, let me put it this way: if I wasn&#8217;t crazy/stupid enough to be developing my own content management system, I&#8217;d be all over TypePad in a heartbeat.  Maybe the next round of beta testing&#8230;</p>"<br />
