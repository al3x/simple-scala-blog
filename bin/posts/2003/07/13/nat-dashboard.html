<h1>Nat&#8217;s Dashboard</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Nat&#8217;s we-can-do-it-before-Microsoft <a href=\"http://www.nat.org/dashboard/\">dashboard</a> for <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">GNOME</span></span></span></span> (and theoretically anything else you can write an interface for) is pretty cool.  It&#8217;s the first thing I&#8217;ve seen in a while that made me think, &#8220;huh, but we don&#8217;t have that <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">OS X</span></span></span></span>&#8230;&#8221;  Basically, the dashboard is a constantly updated and searchable index of what you do on your computer: IM and <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">IRC</span></span></span></span> conversations, files you&#8217;re browsing through, calls received by your peered, Bluetooth phone, whatever, it&#8217;s right there and easy to get (back) to.  The <a href=\"http://rdfweb.org/mt/foaflog/archives/000044.html\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">FOAF</span></span></span></span> integration</a> is particularly cool, as it groks someone&#8217;s number or address and displays other information about them; a more persistent form of <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">OS X</span></span></span></span>&#8217;s Mail.app showing if the person you&#8217;re writing to is on <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">AIM</span></span></span></span> or not.  Anyway, the dang thing is cool, so check it out.  It might make desktop Linux tolerable someday.</p>"<br />
