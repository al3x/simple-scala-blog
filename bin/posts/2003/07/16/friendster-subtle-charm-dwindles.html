<h1>Friendster&#8217;s Subtle Charm Dwindles</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>So obviously I&#8217;m <em>the</em> first person to ever realize the potential of Friendster, its complexity, its sheer volume, its myriad applications.  The first.  And after a couple days of exploring and, in all honesty, &#8220;checking out the prospects,&#8221; I&#8217;ve come to an arrogant and generalized conclusion: most people on Friendster are really skeezy.  Granted, there are exceptions: married folks, people genuinely looking for friends and others who share their interests and activities, and the occasional nice single person looking for a relationship.  Perhaps most people <em>are</em> just kinda sleazy and creepy, but I&#8217;m not willing to be that cynical.  I think Friendster mainly attracts two kinds of people: the skeezy types and the types who dig the idea of a good social networking site.  That latter bunch are alright in my book, but I think they&#8217;re lost in a sea of dating/cheap sex-hungry creeps.  It may also be that the medium encourages people to be snarky, self-possessed, over-cute, and so forth; those little &#8220;interests&#8221; and &#8220;about me&#8221; fields aren&#8217;t exactly a damn autobiography.  So I cut a little slack; stay too long in a pick-up bar and pretty soon you&#8217;ll be asking &#8220;hey baby, what&#8217;s your sign?&#8221; <br /><br /><br /><br />Is this impression of Friendster unique to me?  Appropriately enough, a friend of a friend says &#8220;Friendster is just another way to A/S/L your way into someone&#8217;s pants,&#8221; referring to the common question on the notoriously sleazy America Online chatrooms: &#8220;Age/Sex/Location?&#8221;  Not just me, apparently.  But in the end, if Friendster gets people together then it&#8217;s earned its chaps as a community, and as <em>good</em> social software.  Whether it&#8217;s the community the site itself fosters or its ugly reflection of &#8220;real life&#8221; social dynamics that turns me off I&#8217;ll not quite be able to pin down.  Suffice to say, it&#8217;s only out of hope of finding those couple nice, interesting folks that I leave my profile up.</p>"<br />
