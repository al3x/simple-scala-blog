<h1>Quality InfoSec Advice</h1>
--- <br />- |<br />  <p>...from someone who&#8217;s got a pretty good idea about those sort of things.  Rain Forest Puppy updated his personal website last month, and with that updated penned a brief <a href="http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/txt/evolution.txt">&#8220;state of security&#8221; piece</a>.  An excerpt from the conclusion (emphasis mine):</p><br /><br /><br />- |<br />  <blockquote>&#8220;Security is a state of being, not a state<br />of budget.  He with the most firewalls still does not win.  Put down that<br />honeypot and keep up to date on your patches.  <strong>Demand better security from<br />vendors and hold them responsible.</strong>  Use what you have, and make sure you<br />know how to use it properly and effectively.&#8221;</blockquote><br /><br /><br />- <p>A-freakin&#8217;-men.</p><br />
