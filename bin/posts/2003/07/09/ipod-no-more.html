<h1>iPod No More?</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>With my lengthy and frequent summer school commutes from Bethesda to Baltimore about to end for the summer I&#8217;m considering selling my 30GB iPod.  It was a lot of money &#8211; money I only sort of have &#8211; and I can&#8217;t see myself using it too often come fall&#8217;s return to college life, save at the gym on campus.<br/><br /><br /><br /><br />Moreover, I get the distinct feeling that Apple won&#8217;t release what I consider to be the iPod&#8217;s killer app (beyond being the best damn portable audio device around): portable stereo realtime-encoded audio with an interface that works.  There&#8217;s too small a market for such an add-on, and it would cause many the IP legal headache if it becomes concert bootlegger&#8217;s new best friend.  Such recording capabilities will likely lie dormant in the 3G iPods, or will be exploited in a markedly un-useful way, like being built into a bulky revised dock.<br /><br /><br /><br />All that said: <b>anyone wanna buy an iPod?</b>  I&#8217;ll throw in headphones that don&#8217;t suck.  Make me an offer I can&#8217;t refuse before change my mind or eBay the thing.</p>"<br />
