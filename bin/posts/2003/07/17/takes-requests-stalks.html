<h1>Takes Requests. Stalks.</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Tony Pierce has a <a href="http://www.tonypierce.com/">vanity domain</a>, and on it a <a href="http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/bloggy.htm">blog</a>.  The other day he had a long, amusing <a href="http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/2003_07_13_blogarc.htm#105830359651621061">post</a> about Friendster girls (a recent topic of interest to me), which concluded in the sentence &#8220;[A]nd one day my children will ask me why i married their mother and i will say [&#8220;]boredom and defeat.[&#8220;]  [A]nd then i will ask him not to talk to me for the rest of the evening if its ok with them&#8221; (punctuation and capitalization mine, non-agreeing pronouns his).  So I left, in all good humor, a comment on that post requesting, &#8220;Please do not have children.&#8221;  In what is apparently his style, or &#8216;steez,&#8217; he used my comment as inspiration for another thoroughly entertaining self-reflecting little <a href="http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/2003_07_13_blogarc.htm#105841412767294069">blog nugget</a>.  And then <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">AIM</span></span></span></span>&#8217;d me to say so.  And has apparently checked out the IP from which I posted.<br /><br /><br /><br />Nicholas Chase I&#8217;m now quite comfortable with.  This Pierce character, on the other hand&#8230; ;-)</p><br />
