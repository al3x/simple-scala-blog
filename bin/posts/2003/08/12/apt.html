<h1>Apt</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Got the iTunes shuffling through my library and up comes &#8220;Can&#8217;t Stop Won&#8217;t Stop&#8221; by the Young Gunz, a one-beat props rhyme homage to being large and have a popular record label.  Perfectly apt, the next random track is &#8220;Why Hip-Hop Sucks in &#8216;96&#8221; by DJ Shadow, in which a cheesy parody of a commercial rap song beat gives way to a smarmy voice proclaiming &#8220;it&#8217;s the money!&#8221; <br /><br /><br /><br />I think iTunes is trying to tell me something.</p><br />
