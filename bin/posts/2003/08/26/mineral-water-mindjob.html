<h1>Mineral Water Mindjob</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>A friend says everyone should be a connoisseur of something.  I agree, and have decided to be a connoisseur of mineral water.  I think it&#8217;s a good choice, personally.  I love the stuff, it&#8217;s relatively cheap, good for you, and attainable.  Mineral water is pretentious (it is gourmet <em>water</em>, after all), but it doesn&#8217;t have the evil robber baron vibe of cigars, scotch, or other commonly connoisseured luxuries.  And while everyone fancies themselves a connoisseur of wine, another friend points out that few actually have the breadth of knowledge to truly be vino-heads. Mineral water seems an attainable thing to be a connoisseur of.<br /><br /><br /><br />Or so I thought.  A look through <a href=\"http://www.mineralwaters.org/\">Mineral Waters of the World</a> broadened, expanded, and ultimately blew my mind, at least as far as a mind can be blown by mineral water.  There is an astounding selection and detail in the mineral water world, hardly rivaling wine or cigars but still quite impressive.  But I see that breadth as a enjoyable challenge, not an imposing deterrent, and thus I know I have picked the right luxury for which to cultivate an expert palate.<br /><br /><br /><br />If I were a true <a href=\"http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/bloggy.htm\">blogwhore</a> (<em>just kidding Tony</em>) I would ask dedicated readers to fund my newfound passion with PayPal donations or bottles of the good stuff itself.  I am not, however, and I arch a sinister corporate eyebrow at bloggers who ask for anything more than bandwidth expense contributions. How about this: if there&#8217;s a water you really like, tell me about it.  And not your usual Evian/Pallegrino kind of stuff either.  Obscure water.  Pretentious water.  Water that&#8217;s more Euro than a Fellini film festival in Prague hosted by a chain-smoking Parisian who lives off university pensions and his banker mistress from Luxembourg dressed in this season&#8217;s Armani who both refuse both the idea of a commonwealth and genetically modified foods on vague grounds that you just couldn&#8217;t understand being a boorish American outsider.  Water like that.  Tell me about it.</p>"<br />
