<h1>Social Networking Redux</h1>
--- <br />- <p>We sorted out a while back that Friendster sucks, is for suckers, and is clearly run by the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked.  This conclusion, of course, was arrived at only after deciding that Friendster was the best thing since sliced monkey.  Go figure.<br /><br /><br /><br />But social networking sites still seem like a damn fine idea to me, which is why I was pleased to stumble upon <a href="http://www.tribe.net/">Tribe.net</a>.  I now have a hastily thrown-together <a href="http://cluster.tribe.net/tribe/servlet/template/pub%2Cpcard%2CPeopleCard.vm?personid=04f31b74-91da-4f5b-bb4a-02f3b056307a">profile</a> there, and thusfar the people on the network seem far more tolerable than the unwashed Friendster masses.  That Tribe is less like a dating site for the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">AIM</span></span></span> generation and more of a &#8220;business casual&#8221; multipurpose social network seems to indicate that the site itself will foster a better network.  Give it a go if Friendster let you down, and don&#8217;t forget to add me as your bestest friend.</p><br />
