<h1>Oh Thank Christ</h1>
--- <br />- <p>MacNN <a href="http://www.macnn.com/news/20783">reports</a> that bash is now the default terminal shell in developer preview builds of the next version of Apple&#8217;s Mac <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span></span>, version 10.3 (code named &#8220;Panther&#8221;).  This means I&#8217;ll save literally <em>minutes</em> switching the default shell in the NetInfo Manager every time I set up an <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span></span> machine.  I mean, I understand OpenBSD using plain old featureless &#8216;sh&#8217; for security purposes, but tcsh (the previous <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span></span> default shell) is just awkward for no good goddamn reason.  bash is easy, bash is featureliscious, and bash is the growing *nix de facto standard these days, despite holdovers in the *BSD world.  Good move, Panther team.</p><br />
