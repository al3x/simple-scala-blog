<h1>Putting the T&#38;A in Move-In Day?</h1>
--- <br />- "<p><a href=\"http://www.theward.net/archives/2003_08.html#000401\">This post</a> (link courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.makeoutcity.com/\">je&#8217;</a>) on checking out girls on campus move-in day certainly rings relevant, if mildly appalling in its sleaziness.<br/><br /><br /><br /><br />I move back to <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">UMBC</span></span></span> for my sophomore year this coming Sunday.  It&#8217;s going to be bizarre for me to do the college social thing.  I never really got to know anyone too well during my freshman year, and I certainly never &#8220;checked out the prospects,&#8221; committed as I was to what I then assumed to be a longer-than-long-term relationship.  I regret not making more friends on campus, but I still find the idea of on-campus dating odd (if anyone actually &#8220;dates,&#8221; that is: it seems like college kids just pursue belt-notch fucks).  I&#8217;m going to make an effort to be more social, but it&#8217;s going to have to be a <em>very</em> conscious effort.<br /><br /><br /><br />Maybe I&#8217;m inexplicably old-fashioned.  Maybe I already feel like I&#8217;ve sown my wild oats, and drunken sex with a half-unconscious sorority girl on a plastic single extra-long in a 6&#215;6&#8217; dorm room doesn&#8217;t sound like an inroad to self discovery, much less pleasure.  Maybe I&#8217;m too judgmental, too full of presuppositions, too quick to dismiss people for the social setting in which I meet them.  Maybe I need to loosen the fuck up if I&#8217;m going to enjoy this year back at school.</p>"<br />
