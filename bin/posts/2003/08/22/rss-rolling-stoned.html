<h1>RSS Rolling Stoned?</h1>
--- <br />- <p>So, searching for a complete Timbaland <a href="http://www.ohhla.com/YFA_timb.html">discography</a>, I came across <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/default.asp?oid=6884">his page on RollingStone.com</a> and noted that they offer <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSS</span></span></span> feeds, both per-artist and for their news updates.  It&#8217;s pretty crazy that <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSS</span></span></span> has gotten that large, even if Rolling Stone&#8217;s content is less than engaging.  Pretty soon we&#8217;re gonna have Dive Winer singing &#8220;Mo&#8217; Publicity Mo&#8217; Problems&#8221; while Sam Ruby spits battle rhymes.  Or maybe I need to quit listening to hip-hop when I blog.</p><br />
