<h1>Upcoming Music</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>I missed <a href=\"http://www.qandnotu.org/\">Q And Not U</a> at Fort Reno this past week for <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/uncorrupted84/64800.html\">a good cause</a>, but I have every intention of catching them when they&#8217;re back at the <a href=\"http://www.blackcatdc.com/\">Black Cat</a> on September 5th.  But there&#8217;s oh so much more on my musical agenda!  <a href=\"http://www.kid606.com/home.html\">Kid606</a> and <a href=\"http://www.negrophonic.com/\">DJ /rupture</a> are playing Baltimore&#8217;s illustrious <a href=\"http://www.theottobar.com/\">Ottobar</a> this coming Wednesday the 13th, which should make for some crazy ear-fucking din.  Saturday the 16th marks the second <a href=\"http://www.techclub-dc.com/\">techclub</a> event, <a href=\"http://www.techclub-dc.com/techclub_digi-lytes.html\">Digi-Lytes</a>: projected digital photography, quirky sounds, and general 22nd Century artiness will abound.  Then <a href=\"http://www.radiohead.co.uk\">Radiohead</a> <a href=\"http://www.mppconcerts.com/events.php?eventID=65383\">plays</a> Merriweather Post Pavillion Wednesday the 20th.  I&#8217;ve been trying to see them for literally years, and have failed every time.  It&#8217;s a long story.  But their latest album, minus a couple throwaway tracks, has grown on me and it&#8217;ll be great to finally see them (in <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/uncorrupted84/\">good company</a> no less).<br /><br /><br /><br />Finally, I&#8217;m backing up <a href=\"http://www.5dots.net/\">5-to-the-dots</a> at techclub&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.techclub-dc.com/techclub_minijax.html\">Open Minijax 1.1</a>.  We played separate sets at Minijax 1.0, held at the Black Cat a while back, but this time around I&#8217;m lending my skills <em>cough</em> to distorting, delaying, and otherwise fucking up the big 5&#8217;s hand drumming, which will be run through a mic and into one of our iBooks to meet its <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">VST</span></span></span> fate before being forced upon attendee&#8217;s ears.  All this will take place Sunday, August 24th at Arlington&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.galaxyhut.com/\">Galaxy Hut</a>, an intimate space if ever there was one.  I think I also move back to campus that day, so things should be interesting.  But you should come.  Regardless of how long it&#8217;ll take you to get to Virginia.  Even my readers in Canada.  Holy cats, but do I ever have a lot of readers in Canada.</p>"<br />
