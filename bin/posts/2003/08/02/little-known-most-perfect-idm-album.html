<h1>Little-Known Most Perfect IDM Album</h1>
--- <br />- "<p><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/release/1944\">&#8220;Triskaideka&#8221; </a> by Syndrone is my hands-down favorite quirky techno (or <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">IDM</span></span></span>, if you must) album.  Yes, that&#8217;s right: above Autechre, Boards of Canada, all that lot.  They may have style and sheen, but Syndrone bleeds emotion through his/her/its mess of glitch, distant pads, 8-bit melodies, and bass burbles.  If you&#8217;re dry-eyed by the end of &#8220;Intrn|rrr&#8221; either you don&#8217;t get electronic music or someone turned off your emotion chip.  There&#8217;s just something that aches from behind what would otherwise be a fairly formulaic combination of sounds.  Sometimes it&#8217;s sad, sometimes beautiful, and often both.<br /><br /><br /><br />Find it where I did, on <a href=\"http://www.emusic.com/cd/10605/10605391.html\">eMusic</a>.  I didn&#8217;t realize they describe it as &#8220;aching&#8221; on their page too until I went to find that link, but there you go.  Not just me.</p>"<br />
