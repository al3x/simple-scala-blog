<h1>As Friendly As It Gets</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I don&#8217;t do the Linux desktop thing anymore, but I still help out at campus installfests because Open Source Is A Good Idea, especially for teaching people about computers.  What&#8217;s not a good idea, however, is trying to get Linux working on miserable, cheap HP/Compaq/Gateway/Dell &#8220;home consumer&#8221; PCs and laptops that are brimming over with soldered-together integrated parts barely supported by Windows.  Linux distributions have generally offered official and unofficial &#8220;supported hardware&#8221; lists, but these are often inaccurate and out of date. The world has long needed a decent central site for listing Linux compatible hardware.<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.lfriendly.com/">LFriendly</a> could have been that site, but instead it&#8217;s a tiny pile of weak content and endless links back to its sponsor, <a href="http://www.lindows.com/">Lindows</a>.   Lindows has long been the &#8220;bad citizen&#8221; of the Linux community, contributing back little while feeding its own hype machine on the coattails of hard-working open source developers.  LFriendly is more of the same old Lindows bullshit.</p><br />
