<h1>Finally, A Use for MMS</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Leave it to the Brazilians to rig up <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/nm/20030827/tc_nm/telecoms_brazil_kamasutra_dc">on-demand Kama Sutra</a> positions via <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">MMS</span></span></span>.  I laughed, but then I realized just how damn useful that would be.  Well, if you keep your mobile by your bed like I do, I guess.  That&#8217;s the first decent use of <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">MMS I</span></span></span>&#8217;ve yet seen.  How long &#8216;till we can get it (the SutraMMS, not <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">MMS</span></span></span> itself) Stateside is what I wanna know.</p><br />
