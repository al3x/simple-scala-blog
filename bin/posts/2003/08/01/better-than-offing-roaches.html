<h1>Better Than Offing Roaches</h1>
--- <br />- <p>The <a href="http://www.ece.cmu.edu/c3s/raid2003/program.html">program</a> for this year&#8217;s Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection (RAID) conference looks mighty interesting, and student registration is a fairly reasonable $150 (hear that O&#8217;Reilly?!  You&#8217;d get my business at that price, but find me a &#8220;student&#8221; who can afford $600 conference passes!).  A trip to Pittsburgh may just be in my future.</p><br />
