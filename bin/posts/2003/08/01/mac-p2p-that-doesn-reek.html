<h1>Mac P2P That Doesn&#8217;t Reek</h1>
--- <br />- <p>There&#8217;s a new <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">P2P</span></span></span> sherif in Appletown.  His name is <a href="http://gottsilla.net/software.php?site=poisoned">Poisoned</a>, and if that don&#8217;t tell you that he don&#8217;t take no shit, then stranger, you got yerself a bigger problem than that copy of Acquisition sitting in your Applications folder.  Seriously, Poisoned owns Mac <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">P2P</span></span></span>, and it&#8217;s open source, <em>and</em> its authors would rather have you donate to Amnesty International than pay them for their hard work.  I loves it.</p><br />
