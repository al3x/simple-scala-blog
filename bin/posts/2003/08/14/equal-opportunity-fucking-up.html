<h1>Equal Opportunity Fucking Up</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>You better believe I&#8217;m even-handed with the InfoSec criticism: the <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">GNU</span></span></span> project has been <a href=\"http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-21.html\">0wned</a> <strong>since March</strong>, and that&#8217;s a goddamn travesty.  Security is security, whether source is closed or open.  Open <em>should</em> mean better security, though an productive and security-minded open development environment requires people to get involved and speak up about security flaws.  At any rate, I&#8217;ve got just as little patience for this as for the whole Blaster worm thing.  C&#8217;mon people.</p>"<br />
