<h1>So That&#8217;s Who&#8217;s Responsible</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>I&#8217;ve been fascinated and disturbed by the covers of several of <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Venetian_Snares\">Venetian Snares</a>&#8217; recent albums: <a href=\"http://www.pileup.com/babyart/candace.htm\">Find Candace</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pileup.com/babyart/winterinthebellyofasnake.htm\">Winter In The Belly of a Snake</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.pileup.com/babyart/dolldolldoll.htm\">Doll Doll Doll</a>.  As it turns out, all three are by Trevor Brown, whose online portfolio <a href=\"http://www.pileup.com/babyart/_top.htm\">Baby Art</a> is not for the faint of heart.  I&#8217;m serious.  Don&#8217;t click around if you&#8217;re unsettled by mutilated children, brutal sexual imagery, or any of the usual &#8220;extreme&#8221; subject matters that noise artists seem to relish for their album art.  That said, my favorite pieces are <a href=\"http://www.pileup.com/babyart/phm.htm\">Pretty Hate Machine</a>, this <a href=\"http://www.pileup.com/babyart/suture.htm\">magazine cover</a>, and this <a href=\"http://www.pileup.com/babyart/emfa.htm\">CD cover</a>.  Favorite here meaning &#8220;piqued and repulsed by,&#8221; not necessarily &#8220;eager to go out and seek or emulate in the world.&#8221;  You get the idea.  It&#8217;s good sick stuff.</p>"<br />
