<h1>Geek Culture, Geek Girls: Crippling Homogeneity</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Is a subculture doomed to die as soon as it can be identified and marketed to?  That&#8217;s usually the case with music- or art-driven subcultures, which eventually atrophy into the mainstream and fade into kitsch-death.  Geek culture, such as it is, is different.  It&#8217;s not exclusively marketed to by outsiders.  It&#8217;s killing itself.  And it&#8217;s not worth saving.<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#8217;m perpetually disappointed with the very notion of &#8220;geek culture.&#8221;  Wired may have glorified the scruffy hacker genius, the crypto-paranoid, the entrepreneur whiz kid, but marketing chic doesn&#8217;t make a &#8220;culture,&#8221; per se.  What binds geeks together is, by and large, a lack of outside interests.  &#8220;Geek&#8221; has come to imply &#8220;obsessive,&#8221;  and techie geeks are obsessive about a scant few things: computers, networks, gadgets, video games, maybe some anime, a few sci-fi movies, a handful of niche political issues.  Always exceptions of course, but a stereotyped geek lifestyle has been pretty well crafted, and geeks happily <a href=\"http://www.thinkgeek.com/\">sell their culture back to themselves</a>.<br /><br /><br /><br />I like meeting hackers who enjoy opera, programmers who climb mountains, sysadmins who front rock bands, and electrical engineers who paint.  There are plenty of them out there, too, but they&#8217;re increasingly the older generation of geeks, the ones who established the technology that the upcoming generation only loosely comprehends (but uses effectively enough to be labeled &#8220;geeks&#8221; by their peers).  And this generation, my generation of geeks, are not the creative iconoclasts that gave geeks their appeal.  They are consumers, plain and simple: consumers of video game culture, chat room slang, high caffeine beverages, anime soundtracks, and that deadly lack of diverse interests.  I see it on my college campus every day: the new geek guard, already boxing themselves in, making themselves their own demographic.<br /><br /><br /><br />Perhaps I&#8217;m not conveying this somewhat abstract shift in techie social trends as clearly as possible, but I think there&#8217;s a telling example: geek girls.  For most geek guys, the absolute jackpot, better than the fastest chip <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">AMD</span></span></span> can fabricate, better than a leaked demo of the next Final Fantasy, is a geek girl.  You know: that rare creature, the girl who&#8217;s happy to talk about &#8220;computer stuff&#8221; all day, happy to watch <em>The Matrix</em> with you every single Friday night, the girl who runs Linux on the computer she built herself, who can quote <em>Ghost In The Shell</em> at length, who can beat your friends in Quake at a <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">LAN</span></span></span> party, et cetera et cetera <em>ad geekium</em>.  Basically, assuming you&#8217;re a geek guy, she&#8217;s <strong>you</strong> with different genitals (and hopefully a body like Lara Croft).  Geek guys endlessly lament the lack of such girls, girls who can really <em>understand</em> them, girls who are <em>smart</em> and <em>interesting</em>.<br /><br /><br /><br />I think it&#8217;s telling.  What better demonstrates the narrow, obsessive quality of geek culture than prizing only mates within this limited spectrum and dismissing anyone different as stupid or silly?  I don&#8217;t want a (narrow) geek girl.  I don&#8217;t want to come home from a day of coding only to talk about coding.  I want someone who will show me new things, expose me to ideas, art, music, and people I haven&#8217;t yet encountered.  And I think that can be extrapolated to the geek community at large: the community, such as it is, is chock full of smart, capable people.  Why not broaden our collective horizons rather than wallowing in a few limited cultural interests and practices, and searching only for similarly narrow partners?<br /><br /><br /><br />Again, exceptions.  I don&#8217;t fear that there aren&#8217;t geeks with broad horizons.  I fear that it will become the norm for &#8220;geek&#8221; to be a defined way of being, a lifestyle, a target market, an assumed set of values, compatible only with other geeks.  No subculture is so valuable as to benefit from utter homogeneity.</p>"<br />
