<h1>The &#8220;i&#8221; Isn&#8217;t for &#8220;impotent&#8221; Anymore</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Cupertino, we have <a href=\"http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore?family=iBook\">G4 iBooks</a>.  Why Apple revises the i-prefix lines like a draftsman on amphetamines while the Power-lines have been known to sit in stasis for nearly a year I&#8217;ll never understand, but there you go: rugged lil&#8217; plastic G4 notebooks for a song (well, a pretty good song, but way less than the goddamn symphony a PowerBook costs).<br /><br /><br /><br />I love my iBook 700, and I&#8217;d be hesitant to use anything less durable around campus.  I&#8217;d be about one of these if I was in the market, but beware of the 12&#8221; screens: the reduction is size and weight definitely comes at the expense of your eyes.  I would kill, honest-to-god kill, for one of <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/Products/Monitor/Multi_FunctionLCD/Monitor_Multi_FunctionLCD_241MP.htm\">these</a> to come home to in the interest of saving my eyes.  Hopefully <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose/\">Expos&eacute;</a> in <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/\">Panther</a> will help the lack of screen real estate a touch.<br /><br /><br /><br />While on the subject I would just like to remind everyone that Panther comes out Friday, and that it will be &#8220;crazy dope busted fresh&#8221; to a previously unexplored extent of freshness, craziness, bustedness, and dopeness.  If you have a Mac you should promptly seek out a copy, and if you don&#8217;t you should buy one in a vein attempt to make up for your lacking personal traits, of which we <em>both</em> know there are many.  The Mac won&#8217;t improve or remedy them, mind you, but at least you&#8217;ll have a good computer, which is about as much as you can hope for.<br /><br /><br /><br />And, having both threatened to kill and insulted my readership while talking nothing but Mac smack in my first non-moblog entry in some time, I will declare this post complete.</p>"<br />
