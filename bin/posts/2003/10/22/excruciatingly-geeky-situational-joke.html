<h1>Excruciatingly Geeky Situational Joke</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>You&#8217;re playing <a href=\"http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=magic/splash/welcome\">Magic: The Gathering</a>, preferably in a group, and with your significant other.  You wait until your SO takes his/her turn and plays a reasonably good card, the sort of thing one might <a href=\"http://www.cadona.com/~liu/magic/cards/individual/c/counterspell.html\">counterspell</a>.  You say: &#8220;In response, I will tap [beat] <strong>that ass</strong>!&#8221;  Options to sell the gag include actually slapping the posterior of your SO, simply letting the line stand, or breaking into a sprint to avoid the inevitable beating you&#8217;ll receive from said SO.  The lattermost is advisable.  Do not attempt if relationship with SO is tentative or you&#8217;re trying to teach them Magic (these two conditions are likely correlated).<br /><br /><br /><br />My apologies for the painfully geeky nature of this gag.  I assure you, if you&#8217;re even an occasional Magic player it&#8217;s hilarious.  It almost makes me wish I had a girl who played, again, just so I could try it out.  Of course, as self-demonstrated, anybody still playing Magic at college age has serious social problems and should be sent to a leper colony or something of that ilk.<br/><br /><br /><br /><br />At least I don&#8217;t own any cards.</p>"<br />
