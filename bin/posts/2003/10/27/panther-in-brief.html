<h1>Panther In Brief</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>I&#8217;m feeling terse, and much has already been written about Apple&#8217;s new version of <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/\">Mac <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">OS X</span></span></span></a>.  So let me just say this: if I was an operating system, I would have sex with Panther.  I&#8217;d be into pretty much whatever kinks Panther is into (metal, apparently).  Or I&#8217;d least fake it.  Because Panther is very good to me.<br/><br /><br /><br /><br />So, so good.</p>"<br />
