<h1>I Am Quite Lame and Without Possessions</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>You know how I said I didn&#8217;t own any Magic: The Gathering cards?  Well, some friends got me rolling with a few cards as a belated birthday gift and pretty soon I was morally, spirtually, legally, and socially obligated to get some of my own.  I now have, albeit for not too much money (and I intend to keep it that way) several lots totaling some 2400 cards coming my way.  You&#8217;d be amazed what a little eBay sniping (of people whose shoes I&#8217;ll likely be in come two years from now) will get you.<br/><br /><br /><br /><br />It&#8217;ll get you 2400 Magic cards.  Just clearing that up.<br /><br /><br /><br />It&#8217;ll be odd to have non-functional material possessions.  I have a few books and trinkets to my name but I&#8217;m not at all attached to them.  I almost never keep memorabilia, pictures, letters, or pretty much anything physical.  I have my laptop, audio outputs and other sundry peripherals, my phone, my bag, and clothing.  That&#8217;s pretty much it.  Not bragging, not proud (it&#8217;s kind of odd, actually), it&#8217;s just the way I&#8217;ve come to live after years of shuttling between parents, expecting to run away to places far away, and college (in that order).  A bunch of dead-tree cards sitting about, needing to be ordered and shuffled and contained and all those terribly <em>corporeal</em> things will be strange for me.</p>"<br />
