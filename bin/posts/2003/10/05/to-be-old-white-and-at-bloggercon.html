<h1>To Be Old, White, and At BloggerCon</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Just as I was thinking that <a href=\"http://www.bricklin.com/ALBUMS/bloggercon2003/\">the people</a> at <a href=\"http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/\">BloggerCon</a> seemed almost exclusively old and white, Jon <a href=\"http://iheartmena.typepad.com/weblog/2003/10/bloggers_are_ug.html#comments\">points out that they&#8217;re ugly</a>, too.  Harsh but true.  And are those assessments just jealous, bitter lashings-out from two young-ish bloggers who float around the second or third strata of the blogosphere?  Enh, maybe, but I could really give a rat&#8217;s ass about the con&#8217;s <a href=\"http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/day1/grid\">lame</a> <a href=\"http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/day2/grid\">content</a>.<br /><br /><br /><br />Normally I&#8217;m not nearly so multiculti or pro-young people, but a lack of youth and minorities in a forum on blogging just seems to be totally missing the point.  I&#8217;d love to see speakers extolling the empowering nature of blogging and online journalism, champion technologies of those without a voice in the &#8220;real world,&#8221; to a bunch of upper-middle class white people.  Oh, no, wait, no I wouldn&#8217;t.<br /><br /><br /><br />Apologies for the adolescent vitriol, but I&#8217;m only in my teens for 4.5 more days so I&#8217;ve gotta get it all out now.  Still: the ironing, as they say, is delicious.  <em>(And, I just notice when posting this, the ironing <a href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/28746#563644\">does not escape the Gwai Lo</a>).</em></p>"<br />
