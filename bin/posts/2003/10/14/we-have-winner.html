<h1>We Have A Winner</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>The ever-charming Rogers Cadenhead has decided at my portion of the me/Jon Gales weblogger beauty contest, and my mate Scott&#8217;s photo of he and I in a State College, PA Hooters restaurant is <a href=\"http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/stories/2003/10/14/weblogger-beauty-contest-winner.html\">the winner</a>.  Frankly, I couldn&#8217;t be more delighted by the choice of winning photo, or by Cadenhead&#8217;s commentary.  To be fair, though, I wasn&#8217;t recoiling: both Scott and I happened to blink when the photo was taken.  But I was a little timid about the whole ordeal, that much is correct.  I great a huge laugh out of the whole thing.  Kudos, Cadenhead.<br /><br /><br /><br />And man, what the devil was I thinking with that red hair back in the cyberpunk teen years?</p>"<br />
