<h1>&#8220;Drinking Song&#8221; by Rob Dougan</h1>
--- <br />- |<br />  <pre><br /><br />- |<br />  I want to weave a musical spell<br /><br />- |<br />  that leaves you unwell and thinking of me every day.<br /><br />- |<br />  I want to play you a tune that leaves you marooned and troubled<br /><br />- |<br />  each time I'm away.<br /><br />- |<br />  Is there a melody that could lead you to me like a lullabied child lead to sleep?<br /><br />- |<br />  So for one moment in time you'd find that you're mine,<br /><br />- |<br />  and softly I'd kiss you and weep.<br /><br />- |<br />  <br /><br />- |<br />  I want to write a simple song that's so frequently sung<br /><br />- |<br />  that you call me to have the thing banned.<br /><br />- |<br />  Who's charm so endears that whole nations cheer and sigh<br /><br />- |<br />  when you take my hand.<br /><br />- |<br />  Is there a melody that could lead you to me like a lullabied child lead to sleep?<br /><br />- |<br />  So for one moment in time you'd find that you're mine,<br /><br />- |<br />  and softly I'd kiss you and weep.<br /><br />- |<br />  <br /><br />- |<br />  For I'm a gambler that just wants to lose and be allowed to leave.<br /><br />- |<br />  I'm a traveller: with one last mile my journey is complete.<br /><br />- |<br />  I'm like a swallow that wants one long last look before flying east.<br /><br />- |<br />  Last on my list - and then I quit - to kiss your lips and weep.<br /><br />- |<br />  <br /><br />- |<br />  I want to play a silver note that fills you with hope<br /><br />- |<br />  and tames you to feed from my hand.<br /><br />- |<br />  A turquoise chord that invites you to soar<br /><br />- |<br />  and fly to a faraway land.<br /><br />- |<br />  A symphony that gently leads you to sit and be still with me.<br /><br />- |<br />  And grief doesn't frighten me,<br /><br />- |<br />  at it's worst it delights me,<br /><br />- |<br />  'cause I want to kiss you and weep.<br /><br />- |<br />  <br /><br />- |<br />  For I'm a gambler that just wants to lose and be allowed to leave.<br /><br />- |<br />  I'm a traveller: with one last mile my journey is complete.<br /><br />- |<br />  I'm like a swallow that wants one long last look before flying east.<br /><br />- |<br />  Last on my list - and then I quit - to kiss your lips and weep.<br /><br />- |<br />  <br /><br />- |<br />  So for one moment in time you'd find that you're mine,<br /><br />- |<br />  and softly I'd kiss you and weep.<br /><br />- |<br />  </pre><br /><br /><br />- "<p><em>And speaking of weeping: join us at the &#8220;Cry Fest&#8221; Cure vs Smiths dance party this Saturday night at the <a href=\"http://www.blackcatdc.com/\">Black Cat</a>, won&#8217;t you?</em></p>"<br />
