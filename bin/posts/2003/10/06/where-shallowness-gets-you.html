<h1>Where Shallowness Gets You</h1>
--- <br />- <p>So <a href="http://iheartmena.typepad.com/">Jon</a> and I go talking shit about bloggers being ugly and now there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/2003/10/05.html#a945">contest</a> to prove and judge our respective beauty.  The blog community sure horsewhips its dunces quick, don&#8217;t it?<br /><br /><br /><br />By way of explanation, by backing Jon up I didn&#8217;t mean to imply that <em>I</em> was beautiful, merely that everybody ever presented in a meatspace public forum to represent a community should be.  I mean, c&#8217;mon, we don&#8217;t want to be unreasonable or shallow, right?<br /><br /><br /><br />That said, what scale of beauty is this contest using?  I&#8217;m a big fan of the &#8220;Steve Buscemi -&gt; Halle Barry/1-10,&#8221; on which I&#8217;d say I rate a solid 6, maybe a 6.5 in nice slacks.<br /><br /><br /><br />My best to the winner, who&#8217;d have to know the al3x reeeeaaaaaal well to find some ancient photos of me with a compromising haircolor that I believe are still online but would never be found via Google Images or anything of the search engine ilk.  Cory Doctorow has a shot or two of me in his ToorCon 2003 gallery in which I manage to look both shiny and pallid, the dualistic cosmetic gift of combined English and German stock.  Other than those I don&#8217;t think there are too many more images of me on the Interweb that you can get to without an AdultCheck ID.. err&#8230; I mean&#8230;  Crap, I&#8217;ve said too much.<br /><br /><br /><br />I still think all y&#8217;all are old and white as all hell, though.  Even if I&#8217;m not pretty.</p><br />
