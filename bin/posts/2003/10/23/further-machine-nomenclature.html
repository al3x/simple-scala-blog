<h1>Further Machine Nomenclature</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>A ways back I talked about my naming conventions for computers, and mentioned that I had named my previously-nameless iBook in accordance with my &#8220;cool short Japanese words&#8221; taxonomy.  Well, that taxonomy has been broken.<br /><br /><br /><br />You may have noticed the moblog photo of Abby, my new cheap-as-fsck-on-eBay workhorse server purchase.  She&#8217;s one of an array of machines that <a href=\"http://www.umbc.edu/~scottr1/\">llama-san</a> and I have been collecting for a home network lab of sorts.  As a show of faith when combining our various machines and bits of network kit we agreed to drop our respective naming conventions in favor of a distinct and mutually agreeable pool: girl&#8217;s names.<br/><br /><br /><br /><br />Apropos for a couple of lovelorn geeks.  One can say, &#8220;hey, is Vanessa working for you?&#8221;  And the other can reply, &#8220;oh you <em>know</em> how Vanessa works for me!&#8221; or some similar double-entendre.  And we both laugh, and then sigh, and then die a little inside.  It works great.<br /><br /><br /><br />At any rate, I renamed my iBook in accordance with the new scheme.  She&#8217;s now Lindsey.  We&#8217;re trying, by and large, to avoid names of female celebrities, friends, ex-girlfriends, relatives, and the like.  I knew a Lindsey back in gradeschool.  We had a third grade thang going on.  It hardly counts.  I&#8217;m not even sure if she spelled her name the same way.  But it suits my iBook, and that&#8217;s all we&#8217;re going for: girl&#8217;s name that just sound right for the machine, free of any social context.  It makes for a surprisingly memorable array of machines, the test of a good naming scheme.</p>"<br />
