<h1>Phreaknic Is Where I Am</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Drove all night (my hands clearly wet on the wheel despite not having a thing we/they/you call &#8220;radar love&#8221;) to Nashville with some mates for <a href="http://www.phreaknic.info/">Phreaknic 7</a>, which beings quite shortly.  I&#8217;ll be rocking the collaborative note-taking, as I did at ToorCon.  Haven&#8217;t seen any of Nashville yet.  Don&#8217;t really intend to.  Here until Sunday.  Very very tired.</p><br />
