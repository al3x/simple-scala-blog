<h1>The Swift Kneecapping That Is Failures of Backwards Compatibility</h1>
--- <br />- "<p><a href=\"http://iterm.sourceforge.net/\">iTerm</a> has issues with Panther.  It had a couple issues before, like not writing multiple line terminal output to the screen correctly, but now it just hangs when your shell commands get lengthy.  I&#8217;ve come to rely on iTerm quite a lot since Cory Doctorow popped it over to me via Rendezvous iChat at ToorCon last month.  Tabs and bookmarks are pretty crucial when you&#8217;re on a bunch of servers pretty much all the time.  So iTerm not working is a swift kneecapping for me: debilitating, and leaving me looking for a crutch.<br /><br /><br /><br />I can&#8217;t be too bitter at the Big Apple, though.  Steve gave developers ample time to get their apps Panther-ready, and iTerm seems to follow a positively <em>glacial</em> development cycle.  Everything else in my arsenal works like a bomb with 10.3.<br /><br /><br /><br />So, uh, anybody got a better tabbed terminal emulator for <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">OS X</span></span></span>?  Anyone?  Bueller?  It ain&#8217;t GLTerm, so don&#8217;t even start bullshitting on Front Street.</p>"<br />
