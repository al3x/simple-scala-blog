<h1>Hack-kins: Beaten To The Analysis</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Salon has a fine <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/10/30/low_carb_hackers/">article</a> on why so many techies are doing Atkins and other low-carb diets.  The observation that it has the thrill of &#8220;hacking your metabolism&#8221; is one I noted to myself some time ago.  The article makes me think I should go whole hog (no pun intended) and try to shed the few extra pounds I&#8217;ve got sitting about the middle via full-on ketosis.</p><br />
