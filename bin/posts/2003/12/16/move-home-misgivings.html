<h1>Move Home Misgivings</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>As was probably wholly predictable I&#8217;m having some misgivings about a permanent move back home.  And no, it&#8217;s not a lack of parental harmony or the cultural annoyances of suburban life; things have been nothing but pleasant and comfortable since I moved back in last week.  It&#8217;s that, if anything, life is <em>too</em> comfortable: I&#8217;m not challenged to make new friends or otherwise change anything about myself.  Perhaps another semester of social difficulty at <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">UMBC</span></span></span> would be good for me, &#8220;build some [proverbial] character&#8221; while waiting to see if I can transfer for <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">GWU</span></span></span>.<br /><br /><br /><br />I just don&#8217;t want to go back to the social routine I had fallen into this semester.  If I were to move back to my apartment for the start of the new semester in late January I would be most resolved to make some changes and have the kind of semester I should have had this past Fall.  Hopefully I&#8217;ve sorted enough out for myself that I can actually make good on that.<br /><br /><br /><br />So we&#8217;ll see.  I could go either way at this point, and nobody has yet claimed my lease on the apartment, the real deal-breaker.  Should I move back, though, I&#8217;m really going to kick myself for having moved all that kitchenware home.  Damn.</p>"<br />
