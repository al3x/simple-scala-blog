<h1>The Wonders of Healthy, Well-Fed, Curvy Women</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Normally I could give a damn about celebrities and, much less, people blogging about celebrities.  But <a href=\"http://www.makeoutcity.com/\">Jay</a> linked to a <a href=\"http://anise.blogspot.com/2003_12_01_anise_archive.html#107097883225825595\">side-by-side comparison</a> of Renee Zellweger with and without a little extra weight for a role and the results are staggering, at least to these eyes.  She&#8217;s not normally one of the actresses I flip for, but with a good meal or two in her she looks positively luscious, radiant and glowing.  I&#8217;d reconsider my tastes for yes-I&#8217;ll-have-the-cheesecake Renee.  Which I know she&#8217;ll be glad to hear, international superstar playboy bachelor tastemaker that I am.<br /><br /><br /><br />All joking aside, women out there: <em>eat</em>, please.  There&#8217;s nothing more pleasing than a happy, curvy, well-fed woman (and in my experience those three traits go together!).  Turn a zaftig other cheek to societal standards and men who insist on rail-thin females.  Dessert&#8217;s on me if you do.</p>"<br />
