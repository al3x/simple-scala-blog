<h1>Happiness</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I haven&#8217;t posted in five days.  I don&#8217;t have anything to say, not here and not even to my family.  I hardly talk at all on days I don&#8217;t see friends, and that&#8217;s fine.  I&#8217;m not really doing much of anything over this break, and yet I&#8217;m supremely happy.  I sleep a lot, and only one night has been ruined by dreams.  Those dreams.  But it doesn&#8217;t hurt to be back in old neighborhood.  Nothing hurts in anything more than a practical, historical, matter-of-fact sense.  That I can deal with.  Happily.<br /><br /><br /><br />I don&#8217;t have plans for New Year&#8217;s Eve.  Or the following Day, for that matter.  I&#8217;m not bothered by this.  I&#8217;ll probably end up sipping champagne at midnight in Craig and Brittany&#8217;s apartment after a couple hours&#8217; worth of TiVo-ed Jeopardy reruns.  It&#8217;s not the &#8220;new year, new me&#8221; sort of thing I should (?) be attempting.  If I thought I could make strides towards meeting new people out in the drunken revelry of an <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">NYE</span></span></span> club party I&#8217;d go for it.  But I know that&#8217;s not the scene I meet people in, so instead I&#8217;m going to do something familiar, easy, simple, and altogether pleasing.  And tell myself I&#8217;m not putting change off, but just being realistic.<br/><br /><br /><br /><br />My light box tricks me into sunshine happiness in the late morning, when I get up in the windowless basement here at home.  I ride that happiness out with long unnecessary car errands to be driving, to be out in the sun and the air.<br /><br /><br /><br />Tomorrow/today I&#8217;ll go to <a href="http://trystdc.com/">Tryst</a> and sit and maybe code and watch people and hopefully smile at someone, because I&#8217;ve been told I need the practice.  Plus they have WiFi and their Dragon&#8217;s Well is like crack.<br /><br /><br /><br />Things will pick up next week, when one way or another I get back to work-work (break runs until nearly February).  Until then I&#8217;m happy.  Just happy.</p><br />
