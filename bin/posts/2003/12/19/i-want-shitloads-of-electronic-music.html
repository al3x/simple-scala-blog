<h1>I Want Shitloads of Electronic Music</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>With the effective death of <a href=\"http://www.emusic.com/\">Emusic</a> (40 tracks a month?  $10?  When it used to be unlimited?  Fuck <em>off</em>) there isn&#8217;t really anyplace on the interweb I know of that has shitloads of electronic music available for legitimate download.  The iTunes music store has a mostly-miserable major label selection of &#8220;electronica,&#8221; the sort of advert background music that was mildly keen in 1997; nothing that&#8217;s going to rock dancefloors, much less my headphones.<br /><br /><br /><br />A few net.labels are <a href=\"http://www.legaltorrents.com/\">giving their stuff away</a>, and that&#8217;s something.  But if there was a really damn good site selling otherwise vinyl-only electronic tracks from a variety of labels they&#8217;d have a massive market in Final Scratch DJs like myself, not to mention the usual fans.  I don&#8217;t mind picking up rekkids every now and again, but with only a couple of wax dealers to cratedig in left in town my choices are pretty limited.<br /><br /><br /><br />Give me a site that I can pop on to and find the latest well-known label (Breakbeat Science to Yoshi Toshi, Tigerbeat6 to Warp) joints right next to whitelabels and independently-released tracks; all styles represented; internationalized; simple no-DRM bullshit <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">MP3</span></span></span> delivery; make it affordable.  Give me my old favorite record shop in online format and keep it current as hell: I wanna be able to purchase and drop the same garage track that just left the producer&#8217;s basement two weeks ago that some DJ in London is bangin&#8217; <em>tonight</em>.  Basically, <strong>work </strong> that digital distribution network all the kids have been bullshitting about for oh, the last <em>decade</em>.<br /><br /><br /><br />I want shitloads of electronic music online, and I&#8217;ll pay for it.  Who&#8217;s gonna take my money?  Who&#8217;s gonna provide the tools for small labels to get their shit out there?<br /><br /><br /><br />Well, <a href=\"http://www.rojisan.com/blog/cat_music_business.html\">Roj</a> might ;)</p>"<br />
