<h1>X-Mas iPod Begets Accessorizing</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Looks like I&#8217;m getting every geek&#8217;s Christmas dream gift tomorrow: a lovely snow white 20GB <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ipod/\">iPod</a>.  Loyal readers may recall that I had a fat ol&#8217; 40GB iPod for awhile this past summer, but that I ended up selling it for fear of non-use during the semester and fiscal concerns (read: I couldn&#8217;t afford it when I bought it, and eBay is friendlier than the repo man).  I had some issues with it at the time: its size made it too bulky for the gym (not an issue with the slim 20GB version), and getting it to jive with my car stereo was a daily battle between me and an infuriatingly tempramental, battery-sucking, lower-than-lo-fi Belkin FM adaptor.  How do I hope to avoid further FM adaptor frustrations you ask?<br /><br /><br /><br />Not with an <a href=\"http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/itrip/index.html\">iTrip</a> like all y&#8217;all suckas expect, I reply.  The iTrip may not eat battery or have a paltry four station range like the Belkin, but it&#8217;s still bloody FM.  Fuck that, I say &#8211; I&#8217;m not afraid of a lil&#8217; modding!  I&#8217;m gonna go all out and put a headphone adaptor in my Civic with one of <a href=\"http://www.logjamelectronics.com/piehonaux.html\">these</a>.  It worked for <a href=\"http://www.ipodlounge.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13224\">this guy</a>, so it&#8217;ll work for me.  I hope.<br /><br /><br /><br />Now I just need to settle on a case.  I&#8217;m leaning towards the flexible plastic <a href=\"http://www.iskin.com/exo2.html\">iSkin eXo2</a> but I&#8217;m open to recommendations &#8211; particularly for cases that work well in the gym.  Danke!</p>"<br />
