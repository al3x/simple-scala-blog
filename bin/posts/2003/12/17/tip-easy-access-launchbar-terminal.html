<h1>Tip: Easy-Access LaunchBar Terminal &#8220;Bookmarks&#8221;</h1>
--- <br />- |<br />  <p>Here&#8217;s a very little but very useful tip for you Mac <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X 10</span></span></span>.3 users who use the fantastic <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/">LaunchBar</a> utility and frequently connect to remote servers via the Apple-provided Terminal application:</p><br /><br /><br />- |<br />  <ol><br />   <li> Create a folder somewhere cozy in your home directory and it &#8220;Remote Servers&#8221;, &#8220;SSH Servers&#8221;, &#8220;Shells&#8221;, or something of that ilk.<br />   <li> In Terminal, open a new terminal window with color and font settings you like and go to File -&gt; Save As&#8230;<br />   <li> Select the radio button in the lower portion of the Save dialog next to &#8220;Execute This Command,&#8221; and enter in the associated text field, with the appropriate substitutions:<br />    <blockquote><tt> /usr/bin/ssh <em>username</em>@<em>your.server.com</em></tt></blockquote><br />         Whether or not to run the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">SSH</span></span></span> process in a shell depends on if you want the window just disappearing when you log out of the remote server (don&#8217;t run in a shell) or want it to linger about telling you that it&#8217;s done its duty (do run in a shell).<br />   <li> Give this terminal file the name of <em>your.server.com</em>.<br />   <li> Repeat as necessary for all servers you frequently connect to.<br />   <li> Now in LaunchBar, go to Configuration -&gt; Open Configuration and click the &#8220;Add&#8230;&#8221; button, followed in the next dialog by the &#8220;Custom&#8221; option.<br />   <li> Select the folder you created in Step 1.<br />   <li> Once your folder appears in the list of directories that LaunchBar scans, click on it and in the drop-down details palate set Scan Type to &#8220;Any File.&#8221;  Save your configuration and tell LaunchBar to scan the selected item.<br /></ol><br /><br /><br />- "<p>You&#8217;re now able to open a connection to your most-used remote servers with a mere Command-Space and the first few letters of the server name!  LaunchBar will present you with your Terminal file(s), and simply hitting Return will launch a new Terminal window containing a new <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">SSH</span></span></span> connection to that remote machine.<br /><br /><br /><br />If you really want to streamline your remote work, consider generating an <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">SSH</span></span></span> keypair and uploading your public key as an authentication token: you&#8217;ll be automatically logged in on supported servers!  <a href=\"http://www.cs.utk.edu/~england/ssh.html\">Here is</a> a solid tutorial on this process, and many others can be found.<br /><br /><br /><br />For more Mac <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">OS X</span></span></span> tips and tricks see <a href=\"http://www.macosxhints.com/\">Mac <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">OS X</span></span></span> Hints</a>.
