<h1>Netlabel Advice</h1>
--- <br />- |<br />  <p>I hope you&#8217;re having a more festive Christmas Day, because I&#8217;ve spent the latter part of mine scouring netlabels for all kinds of electronic music.  I&#8217;ve been successful, but I&#8217;ve quickly developed a few pet peeves when searching around these sites.  Netlabels, please:</p><br /><br /><br />- |<br />  <ol><br />    <li> Don&#8217;t release your music in anything other than <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">MP3</span></span></span> format.  Fuck Ogg Vorbis, Shorten, or any other crazy-ass format.  People use MP3s.  Software uses MP3s.  Hardware uses MP3s.  Use MP3s.<br />    <li> If you&#8217;re offering your music for full <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">MP3</span></span></span> download, don&#8217;t bother with a Real Audio preview.  If you&#8217;re offering nothing but a Real Audio preview, just don&#8217;t bother.<br />    <li> #1 and #2 combined: don&#8217;t be <a href="http://www.tokyodawn.org/">Tokyo Dawn</a>, offering nothing but Real Audio and Ogg.  Life&#8217;s too short, guys, even if your music does get hella down.<br />    <li> Take a hint from <a href="http://www.rohformat.de/">Roh Format</a> and employ a clean-but-stylish design and offer plain ol&#8217; MP3s, spicing things up with DJ-friendly goodies like Traktor sets.  Take another hint from the Roh crew and release hard-ass minimal techno that would make Richie Hawtin cream himself.  Seriously, go download some Dupont.  Damn, that&#8217;s hard.<br />    <li> Release early.  Release often.<br />    <li> I know hosting is expensive and hard to come by, but netlabels hosting their content at <a href="http://www.scene.org/">Scene.org</a> make for some slooooow downloads.<br />    <li> More labels should consider offering their archives via BitTorrent, as a generous few <a href="http://www.legaltorrents.com/">already have</a>.  That way the bandwidth costs would be on us, not them.<br /></ol><br /><br /><br />- "<p>All that said, there&#8217;s lots of good stuff out there, and it&#8217;s great that people are making their art freely available, minor issues of presentation aside.  I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if some of my upcoming sets are comprised of seventy percent or more netlabel tracks.  And, when you think about it, that&#8217;s a precedent that really speaks to the electronic music ethic: from the bedroom studio, delivered via the global communications network, right to the DJs and dancefloors.</p>"<br />
