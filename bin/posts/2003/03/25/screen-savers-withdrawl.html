<h1>Screen Savers Withdrawl</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I&#8217;m not much for TV beyond 24 and The Simpsons.  But, at school, the local cable company carries <a href="http://www.techtv.com">TechTV</a>, which is clearly god&#8217;s gift to geeks everywhere.  Presently at home for break I quite miss their nightly news/product/computer help show <a href="http://www.thescreensavers.com">The Screen Savers</a>.  I missed TechTV all the more when I found out that resident <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">TSS</span></span></span></span> diva <a href="http://www.morganwebb.com/">Morgan Webb</a> is co-hosting tonight (she usually just does a small segment of the show).  This is one of those times when TV-over-IP seems downright imperative.</p><br />
