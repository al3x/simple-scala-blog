<h1>Further Consolidation</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Having a &#8220;gear&#8221; page seemed kind of silly, since I frequently blog about the hard/software I use.  So I&#8217;ve tacked on some basic info about my personal tech to the &#8220;<a href="http://www.al3x.net/about.html">about</a>&#8221; page which should be enough for most folks.  The &#8220;about&#8221; page and contact info now come under the heading of &#8220;vitals,&#8221; with credit due to <a href="http://crossroads.net/a/index.php">Adam Rice</a>.</p><br />
