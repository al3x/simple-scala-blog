<h1>Last Night&#8217;s Show: Nada!</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>So yeah, I totally didn&#8217;t do my usual show Monday evening.  Why?  Impending war, overwork, and yet more hardware problems (note to <a href=\"http://www.nativeinstruments.com\">Native Instruments</a>: build a version of <a href=\"http://www.traktor-dj.com\">Traktor DJ Studio</a> that <i>works</i> and I&#8217;ll buy it <em>eyeroll</em>).  This coming week is my spring break, so obviously no show then.  But I&#8217;m planning on whipping up some pretty sweet &#8220;mixes&#8221; in Live that, while largely pre-programmed, should flow like a fresh bottle of sumi-e ink.  Look for that action on Monday, March 31st.  Until then, fresh sounds are to be had from the stations linked to on my radio page, or <a href=\"http://www.emusic.com\">eMusic</a> if you&#8217;re into paying for things.</p>"<br />
