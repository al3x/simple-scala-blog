<h1>Kid606 Interview and More</h1>
--- <br />- "<p><a href=\"http://www.themobius.net/\">The Mobius</a>, an experimental electronic show on <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">WREK</span></span></span></span> out of Atlanta, has a great archive of their shows to date.  Amongst sets from the likes of Richard Devine and Accelera Deck is an interview with Kid606 that&#8217;s a great listen.  The Kid has quite a cult of personality in the <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">IDM</span></span></span></span> scene, so hearing him speak has quite a humanizing effect.  It turns out he&#8217;s hyper, left-coast slangin&#8217;, and has a very &#8220;young&#8221; voice.  Every other word is &#8220;like.&#8221;  But he has some nice comments about music, experimental and otherwise.  Amongst the topics of conversation is the practice of (electronic) musicians releasing under a plethora of different names, which he looks down upon.  Facing the dilemma of which name/identity to adopt for my first release, I found his logic of musicians having enough confidence in themselves and their work to keep the same name from project to project very inspiring.  He&#8217;s also surprisingly vehement on copyright and filesharing: &#8220;Kid606 The Action Packed Mentalist Kicks Out the Fucking Jams&#8221; was intended to be a statement on the last days of Napster, composed from everything the Kid could grab and sample before the <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">P2P</span></span></span></span> network was sued into oblivion by the record industry giants.  Like most small label artists/owners he sees filesharing as a means of exposure he wouldn&#8217;t otherwise get, though wishes people who could afford his music would pay for it, which I sympathize with.  He just seems like a cool guy, and you get to hear some unreleased stuff of his after the interview to boot, so give it a listen.</p>"<br />
