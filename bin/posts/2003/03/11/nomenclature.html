<h1>Nomenclature</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>So, I&#8217;d really like some honest-to-god feedback here.  There are 3,200 results for a Google search for &#8220;al3x,&#8221; and many times that for &#8220;alex payne.&#8221;  If I want something people can easily track down neither name/URL derivation is ideal, though I rank 7th for &#8220;al3x.&#8221;  So, that said, should I keep this whole &#8220;al3x&#8221; thing going?  Practically, it&#8217;s somewhat awkard: geeks get the number thing, most people don&#8217;t; it looks terrible with proper capitalization (&#8220;Al3x.&#8221; see?  awful); and every sysadmin with an eastern european last name seems to have dubbed themselves &#8220;al3x&#8221; as well.  I&#8217;m not sure, as a name to release records under, it does anything other than confuse (&#8220;how do you say his name?  al-three-ex?  that&#8217;s some crazy autechre-type shit&#8230;&#8221;).  As a bit of personal nomenclature, I&#8217;m somewhat divided: I still feel geeky enough to have a number in my name most days, but apparently so do another of other people who employ it in exactly the same open source/tech community forums.  I guess the ultimate question is twofold: (1) should I release records under my &#8220;real&#8221; name, or as al3x, or something else? and (2) should I keep calling myself al3x, or give it and associated things like this domain name up (and where does this blog go if I do)?  Comments, please.</p>"<br />
