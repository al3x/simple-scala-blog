<h1>Doc Searls Linked Me! (Like a Year Ago&#8230;)</h1>
--- <br />- |<br />  <p>As longtime readers may recall, I had my 15 nanoseconds of fame for my impressions on a Commerce Department meeting on <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">DRM</span></span></span></span> this past summer.   It was great: I got to talk to <a href="http://www.mccullagh.org/">Declan McCullagh</a>, piss off <a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a>, and get lots of geeks to admit that being geeky isn&#8217;t necessarily the best way to get their views considered.  But, still considering the nomenclature issue below and doing a vanity Google search for &#8220;al3x blog,&#8221; I came across <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2002/07/30#theInsideAngle">this post</a> on famous blogger Doc Searls&#8217; weblog.  Quote:</p><br /><br /><br />- |<br />  <blockquote>Remember the <a href="http://www.ta.doc.gov/PRel/ma020710.htm"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">DRM</span></span></span></span> workshop the commerce department put on</a> a couple weeks ago? The one that a bunch of geeks reportedly crashed? That&#8217;s how the news went down at the time. For a sense of it, here&#8217;s <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-944668.html">Declan at <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CNET</span></span></span></span></a>, <a href="http://www.geek.com/news/geeknews/2002Jul/gee20020719015490.htm">Thomas at Geek News</a>, <a href="http://newsforge.com/newsforge/02/07/18/0155208.shtml">Grant Gross at Newsforge</a>, and a <a href="http://features.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/07/18/1219257">Slashdot report</a> by a local attendee who was friendly to the dissidents&#8217; cause, but disappointed by their behavior. (Thomas in Geek News suggests that this author, identified ony as  &#8220;al3x,&#8221; was Declan.) [Later&#8230;] I&#8217;ve just learned that it was Alex Payne of (what else?) al3x.net. Shoulda looked it up. Also wrote <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/7/18/0320/43588">this first hand view on the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">DRM</span></span></span></span> workshop</a> at Kuro5hin.</blockquote><br /><br /><br />- <p>So there you have it.  Not only was I, and this domain, blogged by Doc Searls, but I was assumed to be a pen name for Declan!  I guess that&#8217;s a fairly resounding endorsement to keep the domain and associated trappings.  Still not sure about audio releases though&#8230;</p><br />
