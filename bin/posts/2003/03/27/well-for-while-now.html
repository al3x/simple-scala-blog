<h1>Well, For A While Now</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I&#8217;ve been blogging for some time.  Yes, on this site.  Since roughly the inception of <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a>, in fact.  It&#8217;s just that I&#8217;ve taken periodic breaks, switched blogging engines (or wrote my own <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/<strong>/http://www.hyouden.net&#8221;&gt;little community blog engine</a>), and otherwise monkeyed with this site without regard for consistency.  That my archives only go back a few months is for the best, though, I assure you.  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/</strong>/http://www.al3x.net&#8221;&gt;Looking back</a> is pretty embarrassing.  It is through the lessons of history that we, uh, try not to look like total jerkasses.</p><br />
