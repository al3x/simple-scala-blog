<h1>Tonight&#8217;s Show: Improvised DJ Set</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I had a busy weekend that left me with zero time to pick a good genre-based playlist for tonight\&#8217;s radio show on <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">WMBC</span></span></span></span>, so to make it up to my faithful listener base <em>cough</em> I\&#8217;ll be doing a live DJ set.  That\&#8217;s right, just me, my iBook, and Traktor pumping out the jams.  Well actually there\&#8217;s an audio interface and a <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">MIDI</span></span></span></span> controller there too.  But other than the first 1.5 songs I have no idea what I\&#8217;m playing tonight, so it\&#8217;ll be mixed &#8220;on the fly,&#8221; as it were.  I may update after the show with a track list, and I may not.  Catch all the info you need to listen in on the left (&#8220;radio show&#8221;) and tune in!</p><br />
