<h1>Facts and Feelings on War From My Copyright Hero</h1>
--- <br />- <p><a href=http://www.nyu.edu/classes/siva/">Siva</a>, my copyright hero, has an incredibly personal, eloquent, and moving <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/classes/siva/#200012594">letter</a> to those in support of war (and the Bush administration) by way of an unnamed friend.  As always, Siva is more interested in facts and actions than supporting a knee-jerk, platform response.  But he&#8217;s not afraid to communicate the anger and fear that this war and many of the US &#8220;anti-terrorist&#8221; actions have inspired.  I&#8217;ve been on the fence about this war, as both sides of the debate have been so unreasoned, noisy, and pervasive that I couldn&#8217;t get the mental space to make a decision of my own.  But this letter has finally tipped me into an anti-war camp inhabited, I believe, by the minority of people who thought long and hard about it.</p><br />
