<h1>Recorded History Trips Over Itself (?)</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I wonder, sometimes, if blogging has pushed our human obsession with documentation and interpretation over a fantastic hurdle.  Previously, things would happen and they would subsequently be documented.  The length of time between event and recording has shortened gradually as the cost and means of publication has become more accessible.  The detail, and arguably quality and accuracy, of said recordings has increased on a similar timeline.  But as blogging has freed people to document every idea, every speculation, are we not reporting on the future in progress?  By the time an event that has been blogged upon is concrete, it&#8217;s practically old news.  It&#8217;s often reported that more and more people &#8220;hyperdocument,&#8221; doing play-by-play blogging from conferences and such events.  But what I haven&#8217;t yet seen reported is this phenomenon of recorded history tripping over itself, documenting the very seeds of ideas and actions.  I have the feeling I&#8217;m missing something in this assumption, that in some ways this has been in the making long before blogs.  Thoughts?</p><br />
