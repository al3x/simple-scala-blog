<h1>Aww Snap!</h1>
--- <br />- <p>The &#8220;<a href="http://www.nativeinstruments.de/index.php?id=r4snap_us">snapshot morphing</a>&#8221; feature of the forthcoming Reaktor 4 looks amazing.  Imagine being able to switch patches and have a smooth transition between the different settings!  The live applications have got me psyched.  If it works with effects and samplers in addition to synths built in Reaktor,  you could do crazy stuff like shift all the properties of your sampler while going from a subtle echo to massive dub delay, all smoothly.  Wild.  Native Instruments may be taking there sweet time getting stuff updated and ported to <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span></span></span>, but it seems like the wait will be worth it.</p><br />
