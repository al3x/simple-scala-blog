<h1>Operation &#8220;Can You Hear Me Now?&#8221;</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I think it&#8217;s very, very creepy that we&#8217;ve already got US Congressmen <a href="http://siliconvalley.internet.com/news/article.php/2171271">pushing <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CDMA</span></span></span></span></a> cellular technology in Iraq before we&#8217;ve even &#8220;liberated&#8221; them.  Most of the world uses <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">GSM</span></span></span></span>; a few lackluster mobile phone providers in the US use it.  <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CDMA</span></span></span></span> is old and not-so-good, and it doesn&#8217;t allow you to take your address book and number from phone to phone and provider to provider on a <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">SIM</span></span></span></span> card like <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">GSM</span></span></span></span>.  <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CDMA</span></span></span></span> is pretty much a consumer-hostile technology, built to the specifications of telecom giants.  Chances are good that if we let a free market develop in postwar Iraq they&#8217;d choose <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">GSM</span></span></span></span>, if nothing else for the close proximity of <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">GSM</span></span></span></span> equipment manufacturers in France and Germany.  But it doesn&#8217;t look like their market is gonna be any freer than ours at home.  And it looks like it <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38166-2003Mar27.html">may be a while</a> for Iraq anyway.</p><br />
