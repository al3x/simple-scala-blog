<h1>New Digital Camera: World Fears Endless Pet Pics</h1>
--- <br />- <p>You should prepare yourself for some occasional photoblogging henceforth, because I now have a digital camera.  I was originally thinking of something <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/electronics/cameras/5c79/">absurdly cheap</a>, but thanks to a belated post-return Christmas gift my financial options widened, and I settled on the impossibly slim <a href="http://exilim.casio.com/camera_specsS2M2.cfm">Casio Exilim EX-S2</a>.  It&#8217;s just lovely, and apparently is the <a href="http://exilim.casio.com/reviews.cfm">preferred camera</a> of Apple co-founder Steve Wozniack <sup>_</sup>  I&#8217;ll try not to post any terribly mundane snaphots (pets, day-to-day activities, assassinations), just the oddball shutterbugging (shutterbuggery?).  If I ever get tired of tiny silver electronics it&#8217;s time to die.</p><br />
