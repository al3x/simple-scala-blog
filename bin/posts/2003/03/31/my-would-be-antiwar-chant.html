<h1>My Would-Be Antiwar Chant</h1>
--- <br />- |<br />  <p>If I were a <a href="http://www.thesimon.com/article_of_week/266/">filthy antiwar protester</a> (ha!), I think my chant would go something like this:</p><br /><br /><br />- |<br />  <blockquote><br />Hey Big Brother, war ain&#8217;t peace,<br /><br />and two plus two ain&#8217;t five!<br /><br />Baghdad isn&#8217;t up for lease<br /><br />and bombing Iraqis is jive!<br /></blockquote><br /><br /><br />- <p>The protest movement totally sweats me.</p><br />
