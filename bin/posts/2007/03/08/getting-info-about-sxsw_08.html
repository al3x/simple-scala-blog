<h1>Getting Info About SXSW</h1>
<p>The information floodgates surrounding <a href="http://www.sxsw.com/"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">SXSW</span></span></a> seem to have finally opened.  Posts are frequently on <a href="http://www.sxswbaby.com/"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">SXSW</span></span> Baby</a> and every other blogger in my feed reader is mentioning their travel plans for Austin.  It’s exciting, no doubt.</p><br /><br />   <p>Probably the weakest information resource surrounding <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SXSW</span></span> is the official site itself.  Given that the interactive portion of the conference plays host to some of the world’s top designers and information architects, you’d think they could put together a calendar of panels that’s remotely readable.  The disjointed offerings in the <a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/toolbox/"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">SXSW</span></span> Toolbox</a> are little help.  The <a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/toolbox/reg_directory/">registrant directory</a> looks so broken and user-hostile in Safari that I popped over to Firefox just to double-check that it wasn’t a rendering issue.  No, it isn’t.  It just looks like My First Rails App™.  Yikes.</p><br /><br />   <p>Thankfully, <a href="http://sxsw07.conferenceer.com/">Conferenceer</a> came along this week.  This elegant web application offers a directory of attendees, a nice list of panels, smart calendaring, and an aggregated feed of attendee blogs.  In short, it’s the package that <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SXSW</span></span> should be using.  It’s great to see that so many attendees have jumped on it.  Kudos to its developer, <a href="http://sxsw07.conferenceer.com/people/jacob-patton">Jacob Patton</a>.</p><br /><br />   <p>I’ve not yet decided how I’m going to approach note taking and blogging at the conference.  My gut tells me that there’s going to be way too much to try to cram into daily posts.</p>
