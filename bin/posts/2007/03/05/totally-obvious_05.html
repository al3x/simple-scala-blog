<h1>Totally Obvious</h1>
<p>I’m happy to announce that today is my first official day as a full-time <a href="http://obvious.com/">Obvious</a> employee.</p><br /><br />   <p>If you’re a frequent visitor to the <a href="http://twitter.com/help/aboutus">About Us</a> page on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, you’ll notice that I’ve been on there for a while.  That’s because I’ve been doing contract work on Twitter since earlier this year.</p><br /><br />   <p>Our recent trip to San Francisco was in part to see if I liked working with the Obvious folks and vice versa.  I definitely did, and <a href="http://www.synergizement.com/">Timoni</a> and I will be moving to San Francisco in the near future.</p><br /><br />   <p>I’m looking forward to continuing to improve <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>.   It’s been great fun to work on something that so many people are enthusiastic about.  But more than that, I’m looking forward to working with the awesome people at Obvious.  It’s a great place to be.</p>
