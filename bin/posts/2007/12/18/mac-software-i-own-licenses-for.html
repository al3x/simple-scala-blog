<h1>Mac Software I Own Licenses For</h1>
Even after years of using and contributing to open source software, I think good software is worth paying for.  To inspire gift ideas this holiday season, here's a list of the Mac software I own licenses for:<br /><ul><br /><li><a href="http://1passwd.com/">1Password</a> - the best password manager ever.</li><br /><li><a href="http://mirasoftware.com/BPE2/">BluePhoneElite</a> - when I had a phone this was compatible with, it was awesome.   Control your phone from your desktop, pause music when you get calls, all kinds of future-is-now stuff.</li><br /><li><a href=http://growlichat.com"">growliChat</a> - long since rendered obsolete, but was worth paying for at the time.  Hooks up the Growl notification system to iChat.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a> - moves around files for me.  I mostly use it to file away downloads and clean up after deleting applications.</li><br /><li><a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/">MailPlane</a> - A lovely Cocoa wrapper around Gmail.  The best of the web and the desktop.  This is how I survive email.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> - I'm writing this blog post in it.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/">NetNewsWire</a> - if I could tear myself away from Google Reader, I'd probably read my feeds with this.  I used to live in it.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.bitcartel.com/pandorajam/">PandoraJam</a> - another web/desktop fusion, this time making the Pandora streaming music service a joy to use on your Mac.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.scifihifi.com/podworks/">PodWorks</a> - it gets music off your iPhone or iPod.  Essential.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper</a> - the only backup utility I have total and complete faith in.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.macromates.com/">TextMate</a> - the ur-editor.  All the power and flexibility of arcane editors like Vim and Emacs with a beautiful Mac face.</li><br /><li><a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterific</a> - how I interact with Twitter more often than not.</li><br /><li><a href="http://tastyapps.com/">Videobox</a> -  a simple, cute way to get videos off of sites like YouTube and Google Video and onto your iPhone or hard drive.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.techspansion.com/visualhub/">Visual Hub</a> - a simple, fast way to get other kinds of videos onto your iPhone or iPod.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.xtorrentp2p.com/">Xtorrent</a> - My preferred Torent client.  Subscribe to feeds of torrents (great for shows) or search right from the application.  Speedy and stable.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.yepthat.com/yep/index.html">Yep</a> - they say "like iPhoto for your PDFs", I say it's more like iTunes.  Regardless, I can't live/work without it. </li><br /></ul><br />I've also been given licenses for the following applications by their generous, attractive developers:<br /><ul><br /><li><a href="http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/">Acorn</a> - a superb, lightweight image editor that completely obviates the need for me to keep Photoshop on my system.</li><br /><li><a href="http://codesorcery.net/pukka/">Pukka</a> - a pleasant way to save bookmarks to del.icio.us on your Mac.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/voodoopadpro.html">VoodooPad Pro</a> - a desktop wiki notebook thing that I use from time to time.</li><br /></ul><br />Good software is good.  Buy some!
