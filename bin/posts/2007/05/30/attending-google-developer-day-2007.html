<h1>Attending: Google Developer Day 2007</h1>
I'll be at <a href="http://code.google.com/events/developerday/mv-home.html">Google Developer Day</a> tomorrow in San Jose on behalf of <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>.  If there's talks worth blogging about, I'll blog about them.  If you're gonna be there, say hi!  I'll be wearing my Twitter shirt.
