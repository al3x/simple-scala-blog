<h1>Beer Blogging</h1>
I'm providing a very minor contribution to my friend Craig's relatively new beer blog, dubbed <a href="http://beersbeersbeers.blogspot.com">Beers Beers Beers</a>.  Craig is blogging up a veritable storm in a stein.  I don't expect to match him in either frequency or knowledge of brewing, but hopefully I can at least contribute in quality of prose and Left Coast beer selections.  Subscribe, if you will.
