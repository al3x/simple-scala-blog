<h1>Where Did That Code Go?</h1>
If you were using <a href="http://actsassanitized.devjavu.com/">acts_as_sanitized</a> for (rudimentary) scrubbing of your Rails application's data, you'll now find it at <a href="http://actsassanitized.devjavu.com/">http://actsassanitized.devjavu.com</a>.  If you previously had issues or patches with the plugin, please share them there.<br /><br />If you're looking for the twitter_monitor.rb script that displays your Twitter updates via Growl you'll now find it at <a href="http://static.al3x.net/twitter_monitor.rb">http://static.al3x.net/twitter_monitor.rb</a>.  Now that <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterrific</a> does Growl, though, I don't know why you'd use it.<br /><br />I'm also sharing the code I used to migrate my blog from a custom Rails application to Blogger.  You'll find that at <a href="http://static.al3x.net/blogger_import.py">http://static.al3x.net/blogger_import.py</a>.  It requires SQL Alchemy and some other libraries.  Much of the code is ganked from the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/blogger/developers_guide_python.html">Blogger API Python developer's guide</a>, but it's got a few tricks that someone might find useful.<br /><br />Lastly, you'll find my old TextPattern export scripts at <a href="http://static.al3x.net/export_moveabletype.php">http://static.al3x.net/export_moveabletype.php</a> and <a href="http://static.al3x.net/txp_update_comment_count.php">http://static.al3x.net/txp_update_comment_count.php.</a>  I hope you don't need them, though.
