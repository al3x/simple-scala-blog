<h1>Positive Security Strides in Rails</h1>
At last year's RailsConf Europe in London, I argued that security is a framework-level concern, and a great place for Rails to offer developers sensible, responsible conventions.   Reading over the Rails changelog just now, I was thrilled to see some positive momentum in the security arena.<br /><br />First of all, Rick Olsen's <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/7592">csrf_killer plugin now comes standard in Rails</a> (you can see <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/7596">more work being done on the merge here</a>).  Edge Rails users can now decorate their controllers with a call to <tt>protect_from_forgery</tt>.  Forms built "the Rails way" will then be secured with a  hidden token.   We use a similar pattern for critical actions in Twitter and it's worked out well.<br /><br />Secondly, the <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/7589">sanitize, strip_tags, and strip_links</a> helper methods are now far more robust.  While Rails's previous string sanitization was better than nothing, it let many non-trivial XSS attacks sneak by.  This change should ensure that all but the most determined attackers can't pollute your Rails-powered site with sneaky scripts.<br /><br />Improvements like these  go a long way towards improving the default security stance of Rails applications.  It's also an example of the rewards of framework usage: you get good stuff for free.
