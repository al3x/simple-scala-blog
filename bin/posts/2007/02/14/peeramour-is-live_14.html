<h1>Peeramour Is Live</h1>
<p>The site I announced a while back, <a href="http://www.peeramour.com/">Peeramour</a>, is now live and accepting testers.</p><br /><br />   <p>I wanted to have the whole thing up and running on the 14th, but I also want to do the proper launch right.  The testing phase won’t last forever, just long enough to get feedback from a group of motivated early adopters.</p><br /><br />   <p>Happy Valentine’s day.</p>
