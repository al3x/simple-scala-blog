<h1>Next Week: San Francisco</h1>
<p>We&#8217;ll be in San Francisco from Sunday the 18th to Sunday the 25th.  It&#8217;s a business trip for me and a vacation for Timoni.  We&#8217;re staying downtown, near <a href="http://www.sfmoma.org/">MoMA</a>.</p><br /><br />    <p>If you&#8217;re in the Yay Area you&#8217;d like to hang out, let me know.  We should be free in the evenings.  I&#8217;m going to try to revisit old haunts and explore some new ones.</p>
