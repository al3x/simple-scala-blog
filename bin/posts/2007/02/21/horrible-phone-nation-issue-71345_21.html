<h1>Horrible Phone Nation, Issue #71345</h1>
<p>A friend was having problems with a series of Motorola Qs, and complained to his carrier until they agreed to give him a new phone.  I asked what kind of phone he was getting.</p><br /><br />   <p>“An <a href="http://www.mobiledia.com/phones/lg/vx8600.html"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">LG VX8600</span></span></a>,” he replied.  “The tech said it’s had the lowest complaints of the past 3 months.”</p><br /><br />   <p>What a way to buy a phone, or anything else for that matter.  “I’ll take whatever sucks least.”</p>
