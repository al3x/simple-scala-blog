<h1>Attending: RailsConf 2007 in Portland</h1>
<p>I just registered for <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/">RailsConf  2007</a> after some internal debate about whether or not to attend.</p><br /><br />    <p>Ultimately, my decision was, as with <a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/">SXSWi</a>, a social one.  There are tons  of interesting people in the Rails community attending that I&#8217;ve corresponded with, or read, or used code from.  The opportunity to chat, kick around ideas, and buy much-deserved drinks is just too good to pass up.</p><br /><br />    <p>If you&#8217;d like to meet up,  please email me, or ping <a href="http://railsconf2007.conferencemeetup.com/p/143-alex-payne">me</a> on the <a href="http://railsconf2007.conferencemeetup.com">RailsConf 2007 Conference Meetup</a> registry.</p><br /><br />    <p>I&#8217;ll be flying in later in the day on Thursday, attending the sessions from Friday through Sunday, and flying out Monday morning.  I&#8217;m staying in the nearby DoubleTree, in what I&#8217;m told is  a <em>fabulous</em> smoking room if you just spray a little air freshener about (yuck).</p><br /><br />    <p>See you in Portland!  (We&#8217;re also going to check out Portland next week, so I might see you then, too!)</p>
