<h1>When We're Moving, and Why</h1>
<p>We&#8217;re moving to San Francisco on Monday, April 16th.</p><br /><br />    <p>We pack our stuff (books and household items; all the furniture is being given away) into a shipping container over the preceding weekend.  Then we get on a plane, cat stowed in cargo, and go.  There&#8217;s an apartment waiting for us in <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/traveler/guide/sf/neighborhoods/hayesvalley.shtml">Hayes Valley</a>.  We might actually be crazy enough to drive to the local Ikea across the Bay Bridge that same afternoon.  If we don&#8217;t, we won&#8217;t have any furniture.  Our stuff arrives a while later.</p><br /><br />    <p>That&#8217;s the &#8220;when&#8221; and the &#8220;how&#8221; of this move.  The &#8220;why&#8221; is, first and foremost and as previously mentioned, to work at <a href="http://www.obvious.com">Obvious</a>.  <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> is growing rapidly and we&#8217;re a small team; trying to keep up with the other engineers from across the country, all the phone calls and brainstorming and small crises, is a challenge.  I&#8217;ve more or less been living on Pacific time since working out there several weeks ago, and I&#8217;m tired of it.  My head&#8217;s already there.</p><br /><br />    <p>There&#8217;s a broader question of &#8220;why,&#8221; though, given that: a) I already lived in San Francisco once and b) Timoni and I really liked Portland, Oregon way more.  The answer is more or less that there&#8217;s <em>more</em> in San Francisco, even if it&#8217;s not all <em>better</em>.  There&#8217;s more neighborhoods, more weekend trips in easy driving distance, more people, more shows, more possibilities, more going on.  More than DC, and way more than Portland.  We really want a change, and San Francisco delivers on the change front.</p><br /><br />    <p>It won&#8217;t be too long before we&#8217;re back to visit on the East Coast, though.  More about that soon.</p>
