<h1>Excising Feeds</h1>
<p>Despite the positive comments on my poll a while back about whether on not to leave <a href="http://del.icio.us/al3x">my del.icio.us links</a> in this blog&#8217;s feed, I&#8217;ve decided to remove them.  Too many irked friends.</p><br /><br />    <p>My suggestion: <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/network">add me to your network</a> on del.icio.us and subscribe to a combined feed for all your friends.  I started doing this a couple weeks back.  It&#8217;s handy.</p><br /><br />    <p>Or: subscribe directly to <a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/al3x">my del.icio.us feed</a>.</p><br /><br />    <p>It&#8217;s probably not even worth mentioning that, while I don&#8217;t post here all that frequently, I post a lot over at <a href="http://twitter.com/al3x">Twitter</a>.</p>
