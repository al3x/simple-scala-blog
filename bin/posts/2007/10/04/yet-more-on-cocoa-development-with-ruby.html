<h1>Yet More on Cocoa Development with Ruby</h1>
Just after the Mac development love fest that was C4[1], my interest in writing a Cocoa application was piqued.  Not being an Objective-C developer (nor having any real incentive to become one), I looked around at the alternatives and saw two different options for Cocoa development with Ruby: RubyCocoa and RubyObjC.  After picking the brain of <a href="http://www.neontology.com/">Tim Burks</a>, documenter of RubyCocoa and author of RubyObjC, I was more confused than ever about how to proceed.<br /><br />Tim has since released a language called <a href="http://programming.nu/">Nu</a>, designed exclusively to build on and bridge with Objective-C.  As part of his rationale for the new language Tim <a href="http://programming.nu/rubycocoa-and-rubyobjc">outlined the problems inherent in bridging Ruby and Objective-C</a>.  Phrases like "overlapping", "inconsistent", and "incompatible" litter the document.  'Nuff said.<br /><br />Nu looks neat.  I built it up from source, ran the demos, and poked at the shell.  It's got a good vibe to it.  But the problem for me arises in the FAQ, in response to the hypothetical, "Can I use Nu without knowing Objective-C?":<br /><blockquote>"No, at least not if you intend to use it to write Cocoa applications. In my experience, it is a mistake to think that you can use Cocoa from any higher-level language if you don’t understand what’s happening at the Objective-C level."<br /></blockquote>So in order to really use Nu I need to learn Objective-C, Lisp, and Nu itself.  All things I'd like to know... except, uh, Objective-C, which I was looking for an alternative to in the first place. <br /><br />I understand the challenges in using a language bridge without understanding the languages on each side of that bridge.  I suppose that redefines what I'm looking for: not a bridge that lets me interact with a toolkit like Cocoa, but a toolkit that supports multiple languages without having to build them from the ground up.
