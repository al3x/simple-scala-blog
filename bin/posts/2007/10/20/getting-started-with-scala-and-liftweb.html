<h1>Getting Started with Scala and Liftweb</h1>
I've had an ongoing dilemma when sitting down to work on Peeramour.   I could write the site in Rails in an afternoon, which is tempting.  Thing is, I write Ruby/Rails code all day.  I'm burnt out on it.  Plus,  I'd like to learn something new if I'm going to be programming in my off-hours.<br /><br />Looking around the landscape of web application development, only one technology has really caught my eye: <a href="http://liftweb.net/">Liftweb</a>, a framework built with the <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> language, which in turn runs on the JVM.  I like that both Lift and Scala borrow successful ideas where appropriate.  I like that both are built with performance, scalability, and ease of deployment in mind.  Most of all, though, I like that neither Lift nor Scala is particularly sexy.  It's just ugly enough to work.<br /><br />Getting started with Scala on Mac OS X 10.4 is pretty straightforward:<ol><li>Download either the Gzip or Bz2 Unix tarballs from the <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads/index.html">Scala downloads page</a>.</li><br /><li>Unpack your tarball of choice and put it somewhere sensible like <tt>~/src/scala</tt>.</li><br /><li>Add the path to the <tt>bin</tt> directory to your shell's PATH.</li></ol>You should now be able to run <tt>scala</tt>, type in some arithmetic expressions, that sort of thing.  Hunky-dory.  Now let's get Lift-ed.<br /><ol><li>If you've got <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> (and you should), do a <tt>sudo port install maven2</tt>.  Maven is a build system for big honkin' Java projects, and it takes care of grabbing dependencies and all sorts of junk.</li><br /><li>Now, grab the actual <a href="http://code.google.com/p/liftweb/source">liftweb</a> source from Subversion.  The packaged versions are <em>old</em>.</li><br /><li>Pop into your new <tt>liftweb</tt> directory and do a <tt>mvn install</tt>.  It'll take a few minutes while Maven grabs and builds this and that, but at the end you'll have built all the examples and whatnot.</li><br /><li>A basic blog built in liftweb can be found in <tt>sites/hellolift</tt>.  Head over there, run <tt>maven jetty:run</tt> and you can poke around at a real actual Lift app.</li></ol>Instructions for starting your own liftweb project can be found <a href="http://blog.lostlake.org/index.php?/archives/62-lift-QuickStart.html">at the developer's blog</a>.  Though that post was written in June, the invocations therein still work.<br /><br />I'm used to working in TextMate, but the only <a href="http://harnly.net/2007/blog/geek/macosx/textmate-bundle-for-scala/">Scala bundle</a> out there is pretty immature.  I'm not after a bunch of IDE fanciness, but good syntax highlighting is a must.  I imagine things are more hospitable in Eclipse, but that way perdition lies.   My next step is to check out the <a href="https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala-tool-support/trunk/src/vim">vim support</a>.<br /><br />Now that I've got a reasonable working environment, tomorrow I'm going to take a stab at some actual code.
