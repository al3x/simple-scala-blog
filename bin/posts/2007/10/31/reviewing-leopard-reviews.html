<h1>Reviewing the Leopard Reviews</h1>
By now, everybody and their mother has an opinion about Leopard.  I can say that my own mother went through Apple's list of <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/300.html">300+ new features</a> and tried out the ones that applied to her after upgrading.  She likes the Mail templates.  Anyway.  Opinions are a dime a dozen, but actually taking the time to do a proper review is something else entirely.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of software reviews.  Unlike, say, music, there's something eminently <em>measurable</em> about software.  You can graph its performance.  You can compare its price.  You can gauge a user's understanding and productivity.  Yet, there's a quality to software reviewing that still comes down to pure aesthetics.  That intersection of precision and emotion makes for interesting reading.  And read I did.<br /><h4>If You Only Read One Leopard Review</h4>...make it John Siracusa's <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/mac-os-x-10-5.ars/">over at Ars Technica</a>.  It's got everything: internals, externals, upsides, downsides, and multimedia asides throughout.  It's an achievement of technical reviewing.  It's also dead-on.<br /><h4>The Bad</h4>The main complaints about Leopard are with its appearance and UI conventions.  You'll find particularly dead-on criticism in ThinkMac Blog's roundup of <a href="http://www.thinkmac.co.uk/blog/2007/10/leopard-stupidity.html">Leopard stupidity</a>.  TidBITS' <a href="http://db.tidbits.com/article/9265">Six Things I Hate about Leopard</a> isn't entirely concerned with looks, but UI gripes  make up four of the article's six points.<br /><br />Probably the best response to the UI gripes is Scott Stevenson's assertion that <a href="http://theocacao.com/document.page/513">satisfying UI design is often illogical</a>.  It's also pretty much the only in-depth defense of the Leopard UI I've seen.<br /><h4>The Good</h4>Even <a hrerf="http://www.pcworld.com/printable/article/id,138964/printable.html">PC World likes Leopard</a>.  So does <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/10/leopard">John Gruber</a>, but liking/defending Apple's output is the very essence of his being.  He spends a lot of time talking about Time Machine.  I don't particularly care about Time Machine, but I understand that's it's full of meaty reviewable goodness. <br /><br />Engadget <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/10/27/leopard-vs-vista-feature-chart-showdown/">compares Leopard to Vista in chart form</a>.  Leopard comes out on top by just a few points.  Paul Thurrott <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/macosx_leopard.asp">doesn't think Leopard is compelling enough to warrant a switch from Vista</a>.  I couldn't say.  Nobody I know uses Vista.<br /><br />In terms of less textual reviews: CNET has a <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/macintosh-os/mac-os-x-10/4505-3673_7-32058772.html?tag=rate">short video review</a> that's extremely positive.  They seem to like the various visual improvements.<br /><h4>The Geeky</h4>Apple has a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/leopard/devcenter/">Leopard Dev Center</a> that you can browse if you have an ADC account; most everything but fancy videos is accessible with a free membership.  The <a href="http://developer.apple.com/releasenotes/Cocoa/AppKit.html">Cocoa Application Framework release notes</a> are probably also of interest. <br /><br />Less officially, Matt Gemmell's guide on how to <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2007/10/28/get-rid-of-your-code-with-leopard">get rid of your code with Leopard</a> describes all the libraries and widgets that Apple has opened up in response to indie developers rolling their own solutions.  Scott Stevenson (again!) has a nice lil' <a href="http://theocacao.com/document.page/510">quick Objective-C 2.0 tutorial</a>.<br /><br />There's been some noise about Leopard not shipping with Java 6.  Gruber points out that this <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/10/shipping_means_prioritizing">basically doesn't matter</a> for the majority of Mac users.  <a href="http://stuffthathappens.com/blog/2007/10/28/os-x-java-definitive-timeline/">The next version of Java is likely coming soon anyway.</a>  Yawn.<br /><br />Lastly on the geeky front, just so everyone knows: <a href="http://ormset.no/wordpress/2007/10/28/leopard-finally-supporting-ssh-agent-at-login/">Leopard ships with a version of ssh-agent that works with Keychain</a>.  That's right: no more custom scripts, no more memory-devouring SSHKeychain.  Joy.
