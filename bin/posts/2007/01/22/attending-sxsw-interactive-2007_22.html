<h1>Attending: SXSW Interactive 2007</h1>
<p>I just nailed down my <a href="http://www.aa.com/">flight</a>, <a href="http://www.wyndham.com/hotels/AUSWC/main.wnt">hotel</a>, and registration for <a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/">South by Southwest Interactive 2007</a> (SXSWi).  I’ll be there Saturday through Tuesday, strictly for the Interactive portion of the conference.</p><br /><br />  <p>SXSWi has come recommended to me for some time, but the wishy-washy content of many of the panels and keynotes never sold me.  Over the years I’ve realized that what everyone says about conferences is true: it’s not about the content, it’s about the conversations between talks.</p><br /><br />  <p>I’ve also come to grips with my preternatural affection for the social end of the technology field, and SXSWi is the foremost gathering place for that scene.  I’m not really certain if I’ll be able to get through four days of talks like “Web 2.0 / 3.0 Arts Entrepreneurship: Make Your Passion Your Profession” and “Parent Bloggers 2.0: Can ‘Diaper Diarists’ Make Real Dollars?” with my patience intact, but I’m looking forward to meeting the people who make the social web happen.</p><br /><br />  <p>If any readers are attending or know somebody nice who is, please do comment.</p>
