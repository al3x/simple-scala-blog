<h1>The Web Is Your GUI</h1>
<p>James Duncan Davidson <a href="http://blog.duncandavidson.com/2007/01/more_on_java_an.html">made a point</a> fairly similar to <a href="http://al3x.net/entries/762">mine</a> about the iPhone being closed to developers, albeit with a Java twist:</p><br /><br />    <blockquote><br />        <p>&#8220;So, you might not have Java in your iPhone. And you might not have an <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SDK</span></span>, but you&#8217;ll certainly be able to run the all the best Java applications out there on your iPhone, as well as all the other great Web 2.0 applications, thanks to Safari.&#8221;</p><br />    </blockquote><br /><br />    <p>The other day a friend asked me what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_toolkit">widget toolkit</a> to learn for adding graphical user interfaces to his projects.  I wrote him back a longish email weighing the strengths and weaknesses of the various options out there: Cocoa is pretty but strictly Mac; <span class="caps"><span class="caps">GTK</span></span> has bindings for just about every language but has a pile of dependencies; <span class="caps"><span class="caps">FOX</span></span> and wxWidgets are highly cross-platform but the resulting applications don&#8217;t look at home on any system; and so forth.</p><br /><br />    <p>What I should have recommended was that he learn more about web application development, even just enough to output and consume basic forms.  Putting a web front-end on your application requires ever less and buys you so much independence.  Why invest time learning how to work with a cumbersome, platform-limiting toolkit for most tasks?</p><br /><br />    <p>As Duncan says:</p><br /><br />    <blockquote><br />        <p>&#8220;Even Sun itself, the champion of making all apps Java, has gone this route. When I worked at Sun, there were a few internal Java Desktop applications, but before I left most of these‰??as well as all of the old native-code ones‰??were being migrated to web applications. After all, which is easier? Distribute a Java application or just tell employees to hit a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">URL</span></span> in their web browser? Update an application on everyone&#8217;s machines or update an application on a server?&#8221;</p><br />    </blockquote><br /><br />    <p>It all makes me wonder how many schools are teaching web application development versus legacy <span class="caps"><span class="caps">GUI</span></span> development.  That&#8217;s going to be a lot of catching up to do.</p>
