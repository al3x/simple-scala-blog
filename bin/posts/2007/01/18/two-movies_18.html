<h1>Two Movies</h1>
<p>In order of viewing.</p><br /><br />   <p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0206634/">Children of Men</a> is not a science fiction film.  It’s not about the future, and it’s not about what life on earth would be like if the human species went sterile.  It’s a film about war, and about right now.  The metaphor of a world without children – that is, a world without a future – is devastating.  I found it hard to watch and harder to look away.</p><br /><br />   <p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430/">Pan’s Labyrinth</a> (<em>El Laberinto del Fauno</em>) is also about war and children, and is not the escapist fantasy that one might expect.  It’s a relentlessly violent film, and much of that violence is deeply personal.  Again, hard to watch, but utterly beautiful.  The politics and history are masterfully interwoven.</p><br /><br />   <p>Both highly recommended.</p>
