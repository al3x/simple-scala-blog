<h1>Updates to Acts As Sanitized Coming</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s been nice to see that there&#8217;s some interest in Acts As Sanitized.</p><br /><br />    <p><a href="http://addictedtonew.com/">John Nunemaker</a> referred me to the <a href="http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/plugins/white_list/">White List</a> plugin by <a href="http://techno-weenie.net/">Rick Olsen</a>, which seeks to solve a similar problem but for views, not models.  Rick himself then mentioned that the <code>sanitize</code> method passes only a fraction of the test cases that he&#8217;s adapted from Rsnake&#8217;s <a href="http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">XSS</span></span> Cheat Sheet</a>, something I&#8217;m well aware of.</p><br /><br />    <p>Over the next couple days I&#8217;ll be expanding my test cases to encompass the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">XSS</span></span> Cheat Sheet.  Beyond that, I&#8217;ll be providing an enhanced filter along the lines of Rick&#8217;s solution.  Rick has clearly done the difficult legwork here; the rest is just a matter of approach and implementation details.</p><br /><br />    <p>Any other feature requests while I&#8217;m at it?</p>
