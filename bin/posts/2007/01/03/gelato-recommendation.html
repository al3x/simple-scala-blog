<h1>A Gelato Recommendation</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.ciaobellagelato.com/">Ciao Bella</a> brand gelato has become a fixture of our freezer over the last several months.  I am here to recommend it whole-heartedly, unsponsored and unabashed.</p><br /><br />    <p>We first tried their coconut, which has more of a sorbet texture than one would expect of gelato.  It&#8217;s become our mainstay desert.  Their green tea with white chocolate is also a good bet, though the green tea would stand alone just as well.  Hazelnut is a bit gritty.</p><br /><br />    <p>Just this evening, however, I tried their fresh mint with chocolate chips.  Needless to say, it spurred me to write the first food-related entry on this blog in I don&#8217;t know how long.  The mint flavor really is garden-fresh, so herbal it barely qualifies for dessert.  Coupled with miniscule chocolate chips it&#8217;s just excellent, sweet and refreshing and unexpected on the palate.</p><br /><br />    <p>We&#8217;ve found Ciao Bella at our local Whole Foods.  Enjoy.</p>
