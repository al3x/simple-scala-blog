<h1>How Google Hires Is Changing</h1>
<p>The New York Times has an interesting <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/technology/03google.html">article</a> today about Google&#8217;s hiring practices.  In a nutshell, Google is beginning to account for applicant traits beyond raw academic performance: unique experiences and accomplishments, personality quirks, working habits.  Beyond that, Google is attempting to evaluate the success of potential hires algorithmically.  It sounds like a  sort of <a href="http://www.eharmony.com">eHarmony</a> for the workforce, and decidedly more granular than their renowned low-pass filter for grades and test scores.</p><br /><br />    <p>Ever since it became every computer science graduate&#8217;s dream to work at Google, friends and family have asked me why I wasn&#8217;t interested in the search giant.  My answer was that I didn&#8217;t think I was what Google was looking for.  I did not perform well across the board academically in high school and college; my grades in math, particularly, were quite poor for someone with a facility in programming.  Beyond that, I don&#8217;t test well (outside of humanities subjects, anyway).  I don&#8217;t enjoy the sort of brain teasers and obscure trivia challenges that Google&#8217;s interview process is infamous for.  My brain seems to be wired to function  optimally only when solving real-world problems; contrived scenarios leave me slack-jawed.  So I&#8217;d shake my head when people asked why I wasn&#8217;t hustling to work there: &#8220;I&#8217;m not their type of geek.&#8221;</p><br /><br />    <p>Imagine my surprise, then, when a Google recruiter contacted me last month.  It wasn&#8217;t for a job that matched my skills, and it wasn&#8217;t for a location that I was particularly enthused about, and it hasn&#8217;t really gone anywhere.  But the recruiter found me through the Rails community and thought, just looking at my weblog, that I might be a good fit.  Either Google is casting a low and wide net, or, as the article says, &#8220;there is some resistance even at Google to the idea that a machine can pick talent better than a human.&#8221;  It was the recruiter&#8217;s instinct that found me, not an algorithm.</p><br /><br />    <p>I share this by way of spreading hope for those of you who thought you&#8217;d never be Google material because you weren&#8217;t a rocking a 4.0 from CalTech.  I&#8217;m still not sure that Google would be the right place for me, but it&#8217;s nice to know that they&#8217;re getting over their &#8220;obsession with grades.&#8221;</p><br /><br />    <p>Some of us were too busy learning to do well in school.</p>
