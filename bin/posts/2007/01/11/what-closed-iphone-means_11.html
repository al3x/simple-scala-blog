<h1>What A Closed iPhone Means</h1>
<p>So the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> is probably going to be <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/01/09/iphone-will-not-allow-user-installable-applications/">closed to third-party applications</a>.</p>    <p>That’s not good.  <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2007/01/11/osx-app-developers-iphone/">Merlin Mann talks about why</a>:</p><blockquote>        <p>“There's the potential here for some serious George Jetson shit and it would be a pity not to capitalize on that as early as possible”</p></blockquote>    <p>Wolf Rentzsch <a href="http://rentzsch.com/cocoa/iphoneIndieAppDevelopment">suggests you file a bug about it</a>.  I did.  Why not?  It’s <em>broken</em>.</p><p>But what would a closed iPhone mean?  It means the opening is in the browser.</p>    <p>The browser on the iPhone is, essentially, Safari.  I have a similar browser right now on my Nokia <span class="caps"><span class="caps">E60</span></span>, and it’s hot.  Like Safari developer Dave Hyatt <a href="http://webkit.org/blog/?p=87">says</a>:</p><blockquote>        <p>“There is less and less need for a special dumbed down version of the web just for mobile devices; instead we can have a single device-independent web thatâ??s presented in the best possible way on a variety of devices."</p></blockquote>    <p>If your mobile browser can do everything your desktop browser can do, you can run fancy web applications.  Web applications are taking the place of many desktop applications.  So does <a href="http://blog.vulnerableminds.com/">Scott</a> need a to-do list app/widget for his iPhone if he can get to <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a>?  Does a designer need an asset management app if she can get to <a href="http://www.fluxiom.com/">Fluxiom</a>?</p>    <p>The point being: if you can’t develop directly for the iPhone, you’re not cut off from delivering a rich experience to its user base if you can build web applications.  That’s big.</p>    <p>The browser is a constraining portal to the iPhone’s full potential and no substitute for Apple opening the device up.  But it’s a start.</p>
