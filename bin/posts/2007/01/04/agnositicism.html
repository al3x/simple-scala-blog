<h1>Agnositicism</h1>
<p>Steve Dekorte <a href="http://www.dekorte.com/blog/blog.cgi?do=item&#38;id=2403">writes about</a> atheism versus agnosticism:</p><br /><br />    <blockquote><br />        <p>&#8220;I personally don&#8217;t like the word agnostic because we don&#8217;t use similar words to make distinctions about certainty when it comes to matters outside of religion &#8211; so using a special word for uncertainty on matters of religion seems to grant it some special status which I don&#8217;t feel it deserves. After all, many people who are religious have doubts, but do they call themselves agnostics?&#8221;</p><br />    </blockquote><br /><br />    <p>I respectfully disagree.</p><br /><br />    <p>I call myself an agnostic not because I&#8217;m unsure about whether or not I believe in a deity, but because I am <em>absolutely</em> certain that proving or disproving the existence of a deity is an impossibility.  I&#8217;m an agnostic because I would not presume that my opinion about faith &#8211; and indeed, opinion is all one can have &#8211; is true.  It&#8217;s a matter of intellectual honesty, not a lack of certainty.</p><br /><br />    <p>I believe in what I can verify.  I believe in what&#8217;s in front of me.  I believe in other people.  I&#8217;m a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_humanism">secular humanist</a>.</p><br /><br />    <p>Dekorte adds:</p><br /><br />    <blockquote><br />        <p>&#8220;I think the term exists to show special respect to religious belief and whether or not one finds it appropriate is a function of whether or not one feels religious belief is deserving of respect.&#8221;</p><br />    </blockquote><br /><br />    <p>With all the believers out there in the world, not at least acknowledging that many people reason from a position of faith is bull-headedly making things more difficult for yourself.  Respect aside.</p>
