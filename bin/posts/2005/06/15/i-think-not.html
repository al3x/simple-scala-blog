<h1>I Think Not</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://www.devon-technologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.php">DEVONthink Pro</a> beta is <a href="http://macupdate.com/info.php/id/18510">finally out</a>.  I&#8217;ve been waiting a long-ass time for this.  In the interim I stopped using DEVONthink.</p><br /><br /><p>I&#8217;m not a big Spotlight user.  I know <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DEVON</span></span> had a pretty chart on their website explaining that their shit was hotter than Spotlight &#8211; especially for textual correlation! &#8211; but getting into a DEVONthink workflow just doesn&#8217;t seem worth it.</p><br /><br /><p>DEVONthink is schizophrenic, and only more so in Pro.  On the one hand, it&#8217;s got AppleScript through-and-through.  On the other, it (poorly) duplicates functionality in scads of established applications: <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSS</span></span> reading as in Safari/NetNewsWire/NewsFire, photo organization as in iPhoto, outlining as in OmniOutliner, <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PDF</span></span> reading as in Preview, full-screen text editing as in Ulysses, and of course hooking WebKit to throw an entire goddamn browser in there.  Add importers/exporters for myriad formats to the mix and we&#8217;re left wondering: spend all day in DEVONthink or all day coordinating between it and a dozen different applications?</p><br /><br /><p>&#8220;Whatever you prefer&#8221; is the likely response, and it&#8217;s fair enough.  But between Quicksilver, creative use of Spotlight and Smart Folders, and some sensible (but oh-so-<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,67774,00.html">obsolete</a>) hierarchical organization I feel like I have a more full-featured workflow that takes advantage of inter-application communication in the way it was intended rather than a do-everything solution in the fashion of Emacs.</p><br /><br /><p>Add me to the list of disillusioned ex-DEVONthink&#8217;ers who sigh &#8220;well, if I had a research assistant to input thousands of documents like <a href="http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/movabletype/archives/000230.html">Steven Berlin Johnson</a> maybe all that textual correlation would be worth it.&#8221;</p>
