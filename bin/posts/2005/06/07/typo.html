<h1>Typo</h1>
<p>I moved this lot over to <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com">Typo</a> because the My First Rails Blog Engine&#8482; I wrote months ago was apparently leaving hung processes all over my host&#8217;s machine.  Which puzzles me, as it doesn&#8217;t <strong>do</strong> anything, but whatever.  Typo has all these &#8220;features&#8221; and &#8220;tests&#8221; is a far better system overall.</p><br /><br /><p>Things might look a little bit different and your feeds may be broken.
