<h1>Not So Evil</h1>
<p>Adam Penenberg, Wired News&#8217;s media critic, is <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,67982,00.html">scared of Google</a>:</p><br /><br /><blockquote><br />When we boot up and get online we hardly notice that Google dispatches a cookie set to expire in 35 years. Then Google filters our reality, dictates our aesthetic, collates and catalogs our memories, chooses what information we mine. The Google experience becomes a collective Rorschach test, which shapes our worldview and affects who we are and what we will become.<br /></blockquote><br /><br /><p>I thought that sort of info-apocolypse talk went out with cyberpunk.  Maybe it still flies in academe.  He goes on:</p><br /><br /><blockquote><br />In exchange for free access to Google&#8217;s resources, Google gets to fire advertisements at us from every conceivable angle.<br /></blockquote><br /><br /><p>I guess we&#8217;re all Google victims, then?  Well, see, Google can <em>try</em> to fire adverts at me, but I&#8217;m not a victim.  Nobody is a victim on the client side.  Grab <a href="http://culater.net/software/PithHelmet/">PithHelmet</a> if you&#8217;re a Safari user or <a href="http://adblock.mozdev.org/">Adblock</a> if you&#8217;re a Firefox user and suddenly: no ads.  Now Google&#8217;s the victim, if you want to see it that way.  You get something for nothing, and capitalism dies a little.  Hooray!  Penenberg continues:</p><br /><br /><blockquote><br />[Google] is hatching plans for an online payment system that would compete with PayPal, which led Robert Hof of BusinessWeek to write: &#8220;Another day, another new Google service that threatens to torpedo yet another outfit&#8217;s business model.&#8221; <br /></blockquote><br /><br /><p>Oh shits!  Competition?  In the <em>marketplace</em>?!  But people love PayPal!  Especially <a href="http://paypalsuit.com/">these folks</a> and <a href="http://www.paypalsucks.com/">them</a> and <a href="http://consumeraffairs.com/online/paypal_01.html">all these nice people</a>!  What&#8217;s Google thinking, going after such a reputable and well-loved company?  <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPDATE</span></span>: Oh, wait, they&#8217;re <a href="http://today.reuters.com/sponsoredby/VerizonNewsArticle.aspx?type=internetNews&amp;storyid=2005-06-22T010114Z_01_N21641206_RTRIDST_0_NET-TECH-GOOGLE-DC.XML">not</a>.</p><br /><br /><p>All sarcasm aside, Penenberg validly &#8220;wonder[s] what impact Google&#8217;s power will have on our culture.&#8221;  When I&#8217;m free to use their <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">API</span></span></a> to present their data however I see fit, I wonder what impact my culture will have on theirs.  And if, as Penenberg suggests, Google &#8220;is really little more than a content syndicator,&#8221; it shouldn&#8217;t be hard to replace them with a socially responsible community alternative, right?</p><br /><br /><p>Or maybe the market puts its muscle behind the wide-reaching resources it sorely needs.</p>
