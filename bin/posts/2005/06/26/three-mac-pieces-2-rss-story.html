<h1>Three Mac Pieces, #2: The RSS Story</h1>
<p>I loves my <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSS</span></span> feeds.  I&#8217;ve been evangelizing feed readers to friends, parents, coworkers, people on the street, and pretty much anyone who will listen for several years.  I used to show them <a href="http://www.ranchero.com/">NetNewsWire</a>, but then that application went in a direction I wasn&#8217;t crazy about.  <a href="http://www.newsfirerss.com/">NewsFire</a> burst on the scene with a slick, minimal interface, and that became my new demo.  NewsFire never did me no wrong.</p><br /><br /><p>When Safari <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSS</span></span> came along with Tiger, my converts asked me: &#8220;what&#8217;s up with that?  Doesn&#8217;t that make more sense, <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSS</span></span> right there in the browser?&#8221;  It&#8217;s no NewsFire, I said.  I tried Safari <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSS</span></span>, briefly.  I handed it my two hundred-odd feeds in one big folder, it choked, I sniggered and went back to my external reader.  For in-browser <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSS</span></span> reading the Firefox extension <a href="http://sage.mozdev.org">Sage</a> gets the job done, but it&#8217;s barebones and <em>not Safari</em>.</p><br /><br /><p>Lately my news reading has been taking more time than my busy self wants to spend.  Clicking through hundreds of individual items and navigating NewsFire&#8217;s &#8220;sliding&#8221; iChat-like groups has not felt efficient.  Flagged items linger in a Smart Group for days on end.  Endless command-tabs between NewsFire and Safari.  There has to be a better way.</p><br /><br /><p>It turns out that Safari <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSS</span></span> is the cat&#8217;s syndicated pajamas if you <em>aren&#8217;t a  jerk about it like I was</em>.  Do like this:</p><br /><br /><ol><br /><li>Get your feeds out of your feed reader.  It&#8217;s got an <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OPML</span></span> export option somewhere.</li><br /><li>Follow the instructions <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20050501091356426&amp;query=opml">Jon Hicks contributed to Mac <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span> Hints</a>.  It means, amusingly enough, downloading Firefox and the aforementioned Sage extension.  Barebones, but practical.</li><br /><li><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CRITICAL STEP</span></span>: if you have a shitton of feeds, like me, <strong>take the time to organize them into folders!</strong>  The organization will help you navigate your feeds and it&#8217;ll prevent Safari from barfing on the next step.</li><br /><li>For the initial run, open each <em>folder</em> of imported feeds as tabs.  This lets Safari recognize them as <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSS</span></span> feeds.  If you&#8217;ve had some feeds around for many moons you might find that they&#8217;ve been redirected and maybe your old feed reader wasn&#8217;t catching that.</li><br /><li>Love in the in-browser feed goodness.</li><br /></ol><br /><br /><p>It&#8217;s way faster.  You can browse great big swaths of news and it marks them read without clicking through every item.  Sure there are ways to do this in a dedicated feed reader, but I get through more content more quickly in Safari <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSS</span></span>.  I like the way it looks, and I like how sensible it becomes to inspect and add new feeds to my collection.</p><br /><br /><p>Adding the <a href="http://pimpmysafari.com/plugins/?c=RSS"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSS</span></span> plugins linked at Pimp My Safari</a>, another fine Jon Hicks resource, will make it behave like your old feed reader, only more so.  Enjoy.</p>
