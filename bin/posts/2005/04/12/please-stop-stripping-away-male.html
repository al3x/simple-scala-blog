Why can&#8217;t men just be men?  Is everyone in this country so insecure and simple that the idea of anything other than the beer-n-sports image of the American male has to be broken into a dismissible social group/market demographic?  Why is the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">NYT</span></span> publishing this bullshit?</p><br /><br /><p>Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m sitting in a tea shop (in the limited scope of the article, that it&#8217;s anyplace other than a sports bar is what counts) with a good male friend right now and wouldn&#8217;t possibly designate that time as anything other than &#8220;time with a friend,&#8221; but I can&#8217;t help but feel that article and the scads of &#8220;metrosexual&#8221; coverage before it should&#8217;ve been left in the bins of the dim, lazy, superficial writers who dreamed these distinctions up.</p>
