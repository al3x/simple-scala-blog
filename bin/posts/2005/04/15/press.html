<h1>P.R.E.S.S.</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s some unwritten law of weblogs that, despite the blogosphere&#8217;s supposed collective loathing for mainstream media (&#8220;MSM&#8221;), every blogger has to mention any and all real actual legitimate press they get.  &#8220;Oh wow the dead trees like me, they really like me!&#8221;  Etc.  I am no exception.</p><br /><br /><p><strong><span class="caps"><span class="caps">MSM</span></span> Appearance #1</strong>: <em>Popular Science</em> &#8211; I haven&#8217;t written about information security here in ages for a variety of reasons, but it&#8217;s a thing I do.  In fact, it&#8217;s pretty much the only goddamn thing I&#8217;ve done for coming up on a year, which is probably why I&#8217;m too burned out on the topic to write about it.  Anywho.  </p><br /><br /><p>My friends and I went to <a href="http://www.defcon.org">DefCon</a> this past year and competed in the annual Capture The Flag (CTF) hacking competition as team Bacon.  We did not do brilliantly, as it was a Windows-based game this year, but we scored first blood, pulled some pranks, and had a great time.  A freelance writer experienced <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CTF</span></span> and the rest of DefCon through the childlike, booze-blinded eyes of Bacon and wrote a story that&#8217;s published in this month&#8217;s <em>Popular Science</em> under the title &#8220;Superstar Hackers Clash In Vegas.&#8221;  By extension of that title, my friends and I are superstar hackers, which we find hilarious.  We don&#8217;t have any major beefs with the article, other than that they took three hours of our collective time to take group photographs and didn&#8217;t use them.  Compared to the majority of journalism on hacker culture, though, it&#8217;s a fine piece.  Skim it at your local Barnes &amp; Noble or whatever.</p><br /><br /><p><strong><span class="caps"><span class="caps">MSM</span></span> Appearance #2</strong>: The San Francisco Chronicle &#8211; Okay, this one isn&#8217;t actually out yet.  But I got a call the other day from a pleasant reporter who interviewed me about the iTunes flirting article (which will apparently haunt me until I die).  I joked with him that I was happy to chat as long as I wasn&#8217;t quoted as &#8220;blogger Alexander Payne&#8221; because, well, blogging isn&#8217;t my profession (and probably shouldn&#8217;t be anyone&#8217;s).  His response pleased me: &#8220;oh, hey, I never thought of that. It isn&#8217;t a profession.  I should stop referring to people like that in my pieces.&#8221;  I gave my two cents on how writing on the web has been around since long before blogging, it will be around long after blogging as a concept or format is taken for granted, yadda yadda blogging is lame please don&#8217;t write about it yadda.  But mostly we talked about iTunes music sharing.</p><br /><br /><p>The <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MSM</span></span> isn&#8217;t scary.  At least, not individually.</p>
