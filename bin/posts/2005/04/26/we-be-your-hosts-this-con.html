<h1>We&#8217;ll Be Your Hosts This Con</h1>
<p>So, there&#8217;s a little more to the Popular Science/DefCon/CTF story.  Sure, we played last year.  Yeah, we had a good time (a time good enough to write about, apparently).  But the nature of the competition left our wheels turning.</p><br /><br /><p>Months passed, and our crew found ourselves out for Thai food one evening during this February&#8217;s <a href="http://www.shmoocon.org">Shmoocon</a>.  ShmooCon didn&#8217;t attempt to offer a hacking contest on the scale of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CTF</span></span>, and its shorter sprint-style games weren&#8217;t popular.  We kicked some thoughts around and were soon dedicated to an idea: we were going to  run Capture The Flag, the biggest hacking competition in the world.  We were going to run it, and we were going to run it better.</p><br /><br /><p>For the past several years the venerable Ghetto Hackers, former multi-year <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CTF</span></span> champions, have run the challenge.  I&#8217;ve only had the opportunity to play in one competition run by the Ghetto and it was, by and large, solid.  A hacking competition is a hideously complex thing, a tenuous web of puzzles and tricks designed to thwart tricksters who eat puzzles for breakfast.  Anyone managing to design a remotely entertaining hacking game deserves merit, and the Ghetto all the more so for taking the burden on multiple years running at considerable expenditure of bytes, sweat, and cash.</p><br /><br /><p>The Ghetto, for the above and other circumstances, decided to make way for new blood this year.  A call for proposals was made several months ago and we didn&#8217;t hesitate.  Then we waited, and planned.  Oh yes.  We planned.</p><br /><br /><p>Today it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-13/dc13-index.html">official</a>.  We, <a href="http://www.kenshoto.com">kenshoto</a>, are your hosts for Capture The Flag at DefCon 2005.  </p><br /><br /><p>We&#8217;re putting together a game that will be fresh for longtime players, accessible to first time players, and all around fun.  If you&#8217;re into pwning stuff I encourage you to sign up, try your hand at the qualifiers, and hopefully join us in Vegas this summer for a great goddamn time.  Spread the word, too: not only can teams register, but we&#8217;re accepting individuals who want to &#8220;lone wolf it&#8221; as well.</p><br /><br /><p>The next few months are gonna be busy!</p>
