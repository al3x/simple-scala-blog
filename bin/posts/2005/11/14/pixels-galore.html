<p>At my office, I spend my workday in front of two 19&#8221; LCDs.  That&#8217;s a lot of screen real estate, and it makes coming home to a 12&#8221; PowerBook something of a disappointment.  I&#8217;ve been living with it for over a year, but poor movie-watching experiences on said PowerBook have made it pretty clear that it was time to remedy the home display situation.</p><br /><br /><p>My solution is a <a href="http://product.samsung.com/cgi-bin/nabc/product/b2c_product_detail.jsp?eUser=&amp;prod_id=LS19HJDQHV%2fXAA">Samsung 960BF</a>, a 19&#8221; <span class="caps"><span class="caps">LCD</span></span> with 4 millisecond response time.  That&#8217;s absurd when you think about it: there are precious few viewing conditions under which one would need such response time, and it&#8217;s debatable if the eye can even keep up.  But damned if I don&#8217;t feel happily upsold on the feature.</p><br /><br /><p>At any rate, the 960BF is a crisp, bright display with a clean exterior that brings Apple&#8217;s iBook to mind.  There are none of the usual adjustment buttons that mar most PC monitors; a power button lit by a diffuse blue <span class="caps"><span class="caps">LED</span></span> is all that&#8217;s necessary, as all adjustments are to be done in software.  Of course, that software doesn&#8217;t appear to work right on <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X 10</span></span>.4.3, but Apple&#8217;s color adjustment agent handles most of the gamma-tweaking one would desire.  The 960BF takes both analog and digital inputs to its <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DVI</span></span> port by way of a supplied adaptor cable.  The PowerBook took to this configuration immediately and is happily spanning the two displays, thought it cannot mirror at any higher than its native 1024&#215;768 resolution.</p><br /><br /><p>Although I use two 19&#8221; displays most of the day, the 960BF seems sizable on my small computer desk at home.  Its one drawback is that it&#8217;s not particularly adjustable, especially on the vertical.  The display was too far from eye level on my desk&#8217;s monitor platform but a touch too low once I removed the platform.  I settled on resting it on an external drive, which doesn&#8217;t quite allow full view of the PowerBook but works well enough with it tipped back.</p><br /><br /><p>I looked at a number of monitors in person before settling on the 960BF.  Though I&#8217;ve seen them on the market for some time now, I can&#8217;t get comfortable with the increasingly prevalent glossy coating that Sony calls <span class="caps"><span class="caps">XBRITE</span></span> and other manufacturers call what they will.  Glare seems an inevitability with those displays, and I wonder how well the glossy finish wears.  This seemed the best of the readily available matte-finish LCDs out there.</p>
