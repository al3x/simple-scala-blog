<h1>The Usual Upgrade Ish</h1>
<p>I tried to upgrade <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com">Typo</a> to the latest release (2.6.0) but it refused to migrate my database from the version my old Subversion checkout was using.  Oddly, a more current version from trunk was able to perform the database upgrade, albeit with the loss of comments and trackbacks.  They&#8217;re still in the database but are not, for no discernable reason, being displayed.  Apparently the new database migrations feature &#8211; or at least Typo&#8217;s use thereof &#8211; could use some work. I will attempt to remedy the lack of archived comments in the next couple days.</p><br /><br /><p>The rest of the site, meanwhile, seems to be a bit zippier.  Rails applications do not perform brilliantly without much coaxing and handholding, in my experience.</p><br /><br /><p>I will have to be very, very bored before I bother to write yet another goddamn blog engine for myself, even as much as I&#8217;d rather this site be powered by <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>.</p>
