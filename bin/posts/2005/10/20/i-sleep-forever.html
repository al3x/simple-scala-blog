<h1>I Sleep Forever</h1>
<p>The other day a post by the multi-talented Glen Rhodes entitled <a href="http://glenrhodes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=9">&#8220;The power of the Sleep Cycle&#8221;</a> made the rounds.  The basic idea is that by making the most of your <span class="caps"><span class="caps">REM</span></span>-phase sleep (the sleep that&#8217;s most refreshing) you can get by on one 4.5 hour main sleep session and a shorter nap.</p><br /><br /><p>Having more time isn&#8217;t the main appeal of Rhodes&#8217; observations.  I perked up at this passage:</p><br /><br /><blockquote><br />[The study on <span class="caps"><span class="caps">REM</span></span> sleep] explains why, when I get 8 hours of sleep I feel tired and groggy, or when I get 4 hour of sleep, I can barely wake up. As human beings, we should know about this fact, as everyone always says &#8220;get your 8 hours&#8221;. Yet some people fare better than others. Why is that? Probably because the more rested people are actually getting closer to 7.5, or 9 hours, while the 8 hour folk feel constantly unrested.<br /></blockquote><br /><br /><p>So I&#8217;m not about to start sleeping 5.5 hours a day, but I&#8217;ve been experimenting with trying to wake up without an alarm and letting my sleep cycles &#8220;come to a close.&#8221;  It works.  If you wake up when your body is ready to wake up, rather than when you <em>want</em> to wake up, the usual grogginess is all but gone.</p><br /><br /><p>For more sleep porn, read <a href="http://circadiana.blogspot.com/">Circadiana</a>.
