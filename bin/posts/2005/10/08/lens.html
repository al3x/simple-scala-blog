<h1>Lens?</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/lens/">Google Reader</a> UI is appalling.  <span class="caps"><span class="caps">AJAX</span></span> does not an instantly pleasurable user experience make, at least not without some thought put into it.  Even Bloglines is less cumbersome.</p><br /><br /><p>The sad thing is, it&#8217;s unlikely that Google will take Reader back to the shop and overhaul it now that it&#8217;s &#8220;beta&#8221; (ie, all but released save a few tweaks, if it follows other Google products).  That&#8217;s the real danger of pervasive &#8220;beta&#8221; releasing: it lowers both customer expectations and the developer&#8217;s sense of responsibility.  It&#8217;s not what the &#8220;release early, release often&#8221; mantra is all about.</p><br /><br /><p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to do better, Google, and don&#8217;t believe the hype.</p>
