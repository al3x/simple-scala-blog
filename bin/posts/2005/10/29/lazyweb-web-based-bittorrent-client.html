<h1>Lazyweb: Web-based BitTorrent Client?</h1>
<p>I need a web-based BitTorrent client that&#8217;s suck-free.</p><br /><br /><p><a href="http://www.torrentflux.com/">TorrentFlux</a> is close, but not that close.  It&#8217;s <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PHP</span></span>, and that sucks.  The &#8220;stable&#8221; version is a year old and bug-riddled, and the beta under active development isn&#8217;t really any more stable, and that sucks.  Its interface kinda sucks.  Did I mention <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PHP</span></span>?</p><br /><br /><p>My ideal solution is written in Python.  It runs on Linux.  It speaks a current version of the BitTorrent protocol.  It works like this:</p><br /><br /><ol><br /><li>I run it and it toddles off into daemon-land.</li><br /><li>I ask for http://localhost:9999 or whatever port I told it to run on and I see a pretty &#8220;web page&#8221;.</li><br /><li>I either upload torrent files or feed it URLs to torrents.</li><br /><li>It downloads said torrents to a local directory of my choosing.</li><br /><li>Detailed status is displayed for each torrent in a clean, readable way.</li><br /><li>Completed torrents automatically start seeding.</li><br /><li>Torrents can be paused, stopped, and deleted.</li><br /><li>It doesn&#8217;t fuck up, screwing up my ratios and requiring entirely too much manual intervention.</li><br /></ol><br /><br /><p>Thoughts?  Recommendations?  &#8220;DIY, jerk&#8221;?</p>
