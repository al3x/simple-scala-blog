<h1>Twenty Two</h1>
<p>Tomorrow is my birthday.  I have no idea what to do.  It&#8217;s a holiday, but I might go to work anyway.</p><br /><br /><p>I already bought myself the only thing I wanted (the aforementioned Coheed &amp; Cambria/Blood Brothers  tickets).  If you&#8217;re feeling gifty, give to <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/donate/">Doctors Without Borders</a>.</p>
