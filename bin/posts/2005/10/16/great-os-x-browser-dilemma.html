<h1>The Great OS X Browser Dilemma</h1>
<p>So you want to browse the web on a Mac?</p><br /><br /><p><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/">OmniWeb</a> is a non-starter.  We don&#8217;t pay for browsers, and I don&#8217;t have the screen real estate for its thumbnail-tabs.  Despite using WebKit under the hood (like Safari), it manages to not be compatible with all the sites Safari is.  Freaky.</p><br /><br /><p><a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> may be free as of late, but no thanks.  It just  has this cheap Windows vibe.</p><br /><br /><p><a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> is ever so <em>native</em>, but it&#8217;s seriously lacking in power-user features.  I basically can&#8217;t use Safari without <a href="http://culater.net/software/PithHelmet/PithHelmet.php">PithHelmet</a> and <a href="http://haoli.dnsalias.com/Saft/index.html">Saft</a>.  Unfortuately, Safari&#8217;s lack of a clear extension <span class="caps"><span class="caps">API</span></span> means those two step on each other&#8217;s toes all too frequently.  Safari routinely crashes when I&#8217;m checking Gmail or <a href="http://www.suicidegirls.com">SuicideGirls</a>, and that&#8217;s like my whole web right there.  Damn.</p><br /><br /><p><a href="http://www.getfirefox.com">Firefox</a> is the seemingly obvious choice: mostly reliable, increasingly ubiquitous, featureful, and hugely extensible.  But it feels wrong on a Mac: the widgets are flat, the interface conventions are just slightly off, and it doesen&#8217;t take advantage of Cocoa offerings like system-wide spellcheck and Keychain password storage.  The 1.5 beta is nice, and faster than its predecessor, but not perfect.</p><br /><br /><p><a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a> is purdy and Mac-like, with the same rendering engine as Firefox under the hood.  Seem ideal?  The problem is, Camino doesn&#8217;t have Firefox&#8217;s extensibility.  All those cool Firefox plugins like <a href="http://adblock.mozdev.org">AdBlock</a> and <a href="http://greaseblog.blogspot.com/">GreaseMonkey</a>?  Nope, can&#8217;t have &#8216;em.  You get the Mozilla engine, you get a Cocoa interface, and that&#8217;s it.  Plus, it&#8217;s not <em>exactly</em> the same as Firefox under the hood; even the nightly builds still have the flicker-on-AJAX-update bug that the last Firefox release is cursed with.</p><br /><br /><p>So you want to browse the web on a Mac? My advice is to learn to love Safari&#8217;s paired-down feature set or learn to ignore Firefox&#8217;s non-nativeness.</p><br /><br /><p>Or, in short, you&#8217;re hosed.</p>
