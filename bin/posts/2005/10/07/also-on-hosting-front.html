<h1>Also, On The Hosting Front</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m pointing my email at Gmail.  I&#8217;m pretty done suffering Mail.app, and I check my email from a browser too often to tolerate IlohaMail or any of the other piss-poor open source webmail clients most hosts provide.</p><br /><br /><p>So if there&#8217;s any oddnesses trying to reach me via email, which there shouldn&#8217;t be, blame Gmail.</p><br /><br /><p>The <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/gmail-helper/index?promo=gdl-en">Gmail Notifier</a> for the Mac is pretty sweet, by the way.  Especially with <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/19508">this Growl plugin</a>.  Mail.app is <em>so</em> off my Dock.</p>
