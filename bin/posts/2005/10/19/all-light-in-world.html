<h1>All The Light In The World</h1>
<p>Every year at around this time I start a battle with the season, a season I ironically adore.  As days grow short and sun becomes scarce the (mis)wiring in my brain begins to direct me towards lethargy, and worse.  It&#8217;s become routine, but it&#8217;s still terrifying to feel it set in.</p><br /><br /><p>Imagine feeling bad, knowing you feel bad, wanting not to feel bad, but knowing deep down in your clockwork that this is how you&#8217;re supposed to feel.  You were built this way.  It feels bad, but it feels right at the time, and the only thing motivating you to change is the memory of a self who didn&#8217;t feel this way.</p><br /><br /><p>I&#8217;m getting better at fighting it.  I no longer wait until I&#8217;m at my worst to do something.  Physical activity is the best counter I&#8217;ve found, and in the last few days I&#8217;ve walked long walks around DC, gone hiking on Sugarloaf Mountain, and gone running around my neighborhood.</p><br /><br /><p>On my way home from that evening run a couple nights ago I saw a gentleman, clearly just about to set off for a jog himself, stopped by a sloppily pulled-over car.  I walked over to find said gentleman attempting to offer assistance to an older man, the car&#8217;s driver, spaced out in his seat and sucking on the covered end of a Bic lighter like an inhaler.  His face was a mask of inhuman placidity, with something pleading showing through at the corners of his eyes.</p><br /><br /><p>&#8220;Are you alright?&#8221;  &#8220;Do you need an ambulance?&#8221;  &#8220;Have you been drinking?&#8221;</p><br /><br /><p>All concerns were greeted with a shrug.  &#8220;Sure.&#8221;  &#8220;No.&#8221;  &#8220;No.&#8221;  He barely shook his head and contemplated returning the lighter to his lips.</p><br /><br /><p>As neither of us had a mobile phone at hand, the other jogger took it upon himself to phone the police from the liquor store on the corner.  &#8220;His license plate: <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OLD JOE</span></span>,&#8221; said the jogger, before we smiled the weak smile of camaraderie in a bad situation and parted ways.</p><br /><br /><p>I ran for a reason.</p>
