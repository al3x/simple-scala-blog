<h1>A Beverage Recommendation</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s no longer the weather for iced beverages.  The citizenry needs warm, even <em>hot</em>, drinks to fortify themselves for the coming winter days.</p><br /><br /><p>The beverage you want is a chai with a shot of espresso.  The chai must be made with a milk base, and preferably from a liquid mix, not a powder.  The end result is rich and creamy, sweet but not <em>too</em> sweet, and not utterly lacking in caffeine.  My classmates and I started drinking them with great regularity in high school, and there was an informal and failed movement to have the beverage called &#8220;the Emerson&#8221; (after our school) at the cafes in proximity.</p><br /><br /><p>In the DC area you find this drink made acceptably at <a href="http://www.trystdc.com">Tryst</a>, where it is called a &#8220;chaipuccino&#8221;, or made exceptionally by several baristas at <a href="http://www.murkycoffee.com/">Murky</a> in Arlington, where you must simply order a chai with a shot.  I am honestly filled with deep, deep regret when I order most any other beverage at Murky.  It&#8217;s a hidden gem.  They even do little swirls of &#8220;latte art&#8221; in the foam they manage to coax from the concoction.</p>
