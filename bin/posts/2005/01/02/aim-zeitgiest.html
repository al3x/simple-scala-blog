<h1>AIM Zeitgiest?</h1>
<p>Finding patterns in vast sets of data is the definition of fun (really: I found this activity reoccurs in large quanities of fun, as broken down in my funtrifuge).  Anywho.</p><br /><br /><p><span class="caps"><span class="caps">AIM</span></span> has a shitton of data: conversations themselves, sure, but slightly more static are away messages and buddy info(s?).  Writing a tool to scrape your buddy list for URLs or common words and phrases in away messages and such is dead easy, but one buddy list with a typical maximum of 150 buddies isn&#8217;t enough data to be fun.  I&#8217;d love to be at the helm of the server farm that drives <span class="caps"><span class="caps">AIM</span></span> and able to scan the entirety of the service for patterns.  Invasion of privacy?  Totally!  Fun?  Just think of the zeitgiest reports you&#8217;d have!  Google eat your heart out: here&#8217;s the flash animation that literally hundreds of thousands of individuals with only a tentative grasp on personal computer use are linking to!  Also maybe genuinely interesting things!</p><br /><br /><p>I recently saw a Lazyweb request for a way to have more than 150 buddies on a buddy list.  Presumably there&#8217;s some way to get at least a slightly larger slice of the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">AIM</span></span> infosphere than we&#8217;re individually broken off.  Once we know how, you can bet I&#8217;ll be eagerly waiting to use and abuse it.</p><br /><br /><p>So put up better away messages.</p>
