<h1>Why Does DC Hate My Ears?</h1>
<p>Something is amiss in the cafes and dining establishments in the greater DC metro area.  Somehow it&#8217;s been decided that indulding baristas and restaurant owners in their musical preferences is more important than playing music that will appeal to a broad swath of customers (ie, generic &#8220;cool&#8221; music with occassional standout favorites apropos to the vibe of the establishment and kept at a volume low enough to allow for conversation).  This has been decided, and the rest of us suffer.</p><br /><br /><p>Example 1, regular NoVA haunt Murky Coffee (formerly Common Grounds): the late afternoon/after-work crowd is tormented with only the most excrutiating tracks from <em>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</em>.  Now don&#8217;t get me wrong, I like me some Lou Reed, and I&#8217;m first to put the Velvets on when it&#8217;s getting on in the day on a Tuesday and I&#8217;ve nothing better to do than go on a four year heroin binge.  I don&#8217;t hate.  But, save the three art student assholes in the place who might be able to convince themselves of the album&#8217;s importance enough to pretend to like it, the furtive winces about the place connoted a shared sense of pair and suffering I haven&#8217;t seen since 9/11 (too soon?).</p><br /><br /><p>Example 2, Clarendon Italian eatery Faccia Luna (where I may have lost my keys the other night): mid-week diners come for the reasonably priced gourmet pasta and pizza and stay despite a soundtrack of <em>unending wailing guitar solos</em>.  Faccia Luna may not be the most prim of neuvo Italiano eateries, but no establishment serving butternut squash agniolloti warrents sarenades by Joe Satriani.  Note to owner: please switch your XM from &#8220;The Boneyard&#8221; to &#8220;Anything Fucking Else.&#8221;</p><br /><br /><p>Example 3, Tryst in Adams Morgan, right now: after half an hour of peculiar banjo music too well-recorded to be anything approaching classic or authentic, a brief foray into something Enya-esque, and now alternating forgetten &#8216;80s almost-pop and Radiohead knockoffs, I&#8217;m ready to give up on the appearance of being open to conversation and don my headphones.  In fact, I&#8217;ve staved off putting them on just keep my ire up for this post.  But seriously Tryst, we all know what kind of joint you are: play good indie rock during the day, play jazzy hip electronic stuff in the evening, and leave your customers happy.  Also: what was up with not hosting an <span class="caps"><span class="caps">NYE</span></span> event?  I would&#8217;ve paid <em>literally dollars</em> to sip godawful champagne at my favorite hipster cafe.  Your loss.  I still love you, though.</p><br /><br /><p>My three examples having laid forth a platform of evidence that cannot be argued with, I conclude with this thought: anyone who thinks that &#8220;never knowing what I&#8217;m going to hear&#8221; when they go to their favorite cafe or restaurant is a good thing is on crazy dope.  Stupid wack dope.  Give me new music I haven&#8217;t heard when I go to a DJ night to hear it, and stay the fuck out of my places-to-sit-that-aren&#8217;t-home.</p><br /><br /><p>Is the background music insufferable in your city?  Comments welcomed, for a change.</p>
