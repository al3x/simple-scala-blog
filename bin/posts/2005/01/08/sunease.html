<h1>Sunease</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s things like <a href="http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=9341">Sun revoking FreeBSD&#8217;s Java license</a> that make me really uneasy about Java development, both in terms of investing my personal time in learning and investing company resources into adopting and supporting the closed and mercurially-governed platform.  Of course there are plenty of platforms that Sun supports (there&#8217;s always whatever OS-of-the-quarter they themselves have developed/re-branded), but that&#8217;s nowhere near the architectural freedom I&#8217;m used to with proper Open Source languages.</p>
