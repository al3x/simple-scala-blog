<h1>SFO</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ll be in San Francisco from this coming Friday mid-day (1/14) to the subsequent Tuesday morning (1/18).  If you:</p><br /><br /><ul><br /> <li> live there and wanna hang out with me;</li><br /> <li> know of a really, really good tattoo shop there;</li><br /> <li> can recommend pretty much any place to eat/shop/do things there;</li><br /></ul><br /><br /><p>...then please let me know.  </p><br /><br /><p>It&#8217;s yet another small trip to tide me over until one of several Big Real Vacations I&#8217;ve been intending on for the last couple years but I&#8217;m looking forward to it nonetheless.  Stupid cheap airfare, too.  Yay for escaping DC in the gloom of winter.</p>
