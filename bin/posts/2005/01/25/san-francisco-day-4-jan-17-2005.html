<h1>San Francisco Day 4 (Jan 17 2005)</h1>
<p>My last full day in SF was not hugely eventful, but a pleasant wind-down.  I got a late start on my only two tasks for the day: getting a &#8220;3&#8221; tattooed on the back of my neck and hitting up the <a href="http://www.chromebags.com">Chrome</a> store for a new courier bag.</p><br /><br /><p>Task one was accomplished at the Haight location of the venerable <a href="http://www.coldsteel.co.uk/">Cold Steel</a> body mod empire.  My &#8220;design&#8221; &#8211; or more accurately, a print out of the numeral in my desired font, Priori Sans by Emigre &#8211; set, the artist worked quickly, curt but pleasant.  He was slightly surprised to find that I <em>enjoy</em> being tattooed; I&#8217;m no masochist, I just like that particular sensation.  It was done all too soon, and I rode an endorphin high to <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SOMA</span></span>, the Chrome store, and a lovely simple black bag just for me.</p><br /><br /><p>The rest of my final day doesn&#8217;t warrant relating, but a scene from my flight back was ripped straight from a sitcom, or maybe a lad mag:</p><br /><br /><p>We all dread being seated on a plane for many an hour next to some terrible passenger: a screaming child with bowels more irritable than its parents&#8217;, a drunken Texas oil mogul, a morbidly obese Shakira fan with open-air headphones.  As the plane filled up around me my three-seater row left two seats beckoning to the cruelty of fate.  I sat in tense anticipation of assuredly reprehensible company.  And then, like angels from some aging pornographer&#8217;s vision of heaven, two nubile blonde European exchange students, seventeen if they were a day, cooed their excuse-me&#8217;s and took the seats next to me.  Of course, gentleman that I am (read: &#8220;in lieu of darker assumptions about international statutory laws&#8221;), nothing more risque than me placing one of their coats in the overhead bin occurred.  I couldn&#8217;t help but smile at the comic quality of it all until I lost myself in reading all the way back to my cold, dark DC.</p>
