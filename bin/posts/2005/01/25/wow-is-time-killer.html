<h1>WoW Is The Time Killer</h1>
<p>I learned something this evening: World of Warcraft, like every other <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MMORPG I</span></span>&#8217;ve ever tried or been witness to, is not for me.  I reiterate my limited gaming preference for arcade-style fighters, silly racing games <em>a la</em> Mario Kart and Burnout, and little else.  This is why I don&#8217;t own a console, much less game on my PowerBook (which did handle the lovely graphics of WoW admirably).</p><br /><br /><p>It probably didn&#8217;t help that my first steps in the virtual world were as Night Elf Druid and an Undead Warlock, according to my Warcrack dealers two of the harder race/class combinations to play.  But what helps less is my fundamental lack of comfort with adopting a pastime that finds me regularly referring to &#8220;Night Elves&#8221; and &#8220;Warlocks.&#8221;  I [mis]spent enough of my youth playing Magic: The Gathering; that dark time is long since over.</p><br /><br /><p>So really, my absence of affinity for the fantasy genre as a whole is probably the deal-breaker here, as all press hype and word of mouth is befitting of World of Warcraft.  Were there a cyberpunk <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MMORPG</span></span> of similar quality I&#8217;d probably be wasting away  in my desk chair rather than typing this entry.  But thankfully for the creative portions of my brain not concerned with gaming strategy (as I hesitate to dismiss gaming as an uncreative pastime) there is no such thing.  Though I lost an evening, tomorrow I intend to make up for it in metric Rails LOCs.  </p><br /><br /><p>And now I know what all the fuss is about.</p>
