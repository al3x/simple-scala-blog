<h1>San Francisco Day 3 (Jan 16 2005)</h1>
<p>Sunday morning took Phil and I back to the Haight to stop at <a href="http://www.futureprimitivesound.com/home.php">Future Primitive</a> and <a href="http://www.upperplayground.com/">Upper Playground</a>, two local purveyors of underground hip-hop fashion, music, and culture.  I found a few sartorial gems and was generally inspired, realizing that somewhere there exists clothing that&#8217;s street without being blinged-out, designed without being pretentious, stylish without being poncey (note to self: more such boutiques, less AX).</p><br /><br /><p>We then took <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BART</span></span> to Berkley and wandered the main drags, somewhat unimpressed (not that we were expecting anything in particular).  A nice lunch at a chain pho joint powered excessive comic book buying at Comic Relief, which now has all my money.  While at the register the cashier&#8217;s friend burst in clutching a copy of Dr. Dre&#8217;s &#8220;The Chronic&#8221; and proceeded to relate a hilarious tale of retrieving the CD from his brother&#8217;s room before said sibling was hauled off to jail for grand theft auto.  It&#8217;s those charming moments that really make a vacation.</p><br /><br /><p>After a brief rest at the house and a lovely dinner at Chow we took the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MUNI</span></span> down to the beach.  Now, this took some sinking in for me: you can take <em>public transit</em> to the <em>Pacific Ocean</em>.  On a whim.  And until quite late.  You can, as I did, watch the moonlight on the water for half an hour without speaking so much as a word to your companions, without thinking much more than &#8220;that&#8217;s gorgeous.&#8221;  And then it&#8217;s back to the city, the beauty of the water happily waiting for you to return.  </p><br /><br /><p>Unfathomable.</p>
