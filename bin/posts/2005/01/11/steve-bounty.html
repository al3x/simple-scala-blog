<h1>Steve&#8217;s Bounty</h1>
<p>I refreshed my browser endlessly on MacMerc and the rest all <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PST</span></span>-morning, and though the first hour of Steve&#8217;s keynote was a little slow (to read about), I think I join the happy throng of Mac zealots elated with Apple&#8217;s MacWorld San Fransisco announcents this morning.  Spoiler predictions and rumors aside, it&#8217;s a great crop of toys.  My takes:</p><br /><br /><ol><br /> <li> <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">iPod Shuffle</a> &#8211; cute as a button, perfect for the gym or people more into singles and hits than the exhaustive record-mongering that&#8217;s got my 40GB iPod bursting at the seams.  I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d buy one, but at $99 for the 512MB and $150 for the 1GB it&#8217;s almost worth it just to have a stylish Apple-made thumbdrive.</li><br /> <li> <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/">iLife &#8216;05</a> &#8211; no comment, really.  Video is totally not my thing, so I&#8217;ve got no comment about iMovie.  Never more than poked around the thing.  GarageBand is fun, but it&#8217;s not how I like to make digital music.  I use iPhoto now and again, and that looks like it&#8217;s got some shiny new newness.  Not gonna shell out for it, but iLife looks good on the whole.</li><br /> <li> <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/">iWork</a> &#8211; I&#8217;ve enjoyed using Keynote, but it needed some work, and it looks like it got it.  As for Pages, I almost never fire up a full-blown word processor anymore, but it looks gorgeous, like MS Office got InDesign&#8217;s supermodel step-sister knocked up at some champagne -soaked house party in Beverly Hills it managed to crash (&#8216;cos seriously, who&#8217;s inviting Office?).  I almost wish I needed to do, y&#8217;know, word processing, just to give it a spin.  Maybe I&#8217;ll do up a fake invitation to a baby shower and send it to everyone I don&#8217;t like.</li><br /><li> <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac mini</a> &#8211; Sure, we heard it was coming, but that doesn&#8217;t make it any less hott [sic].  Well, the skimpy <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RAM</span></span> and tiny hard drive almost does, but the economics of the specs are understandable.  And sure, it could&#8217;ve been the iTivo king hell set-top media convergence box.  While we&#8217;re at it, it&#8217;s puzzling that Apple didn&#8217;t introduce a more affordable display, as I can see some potential buyers aghast at Apple&#8217;s own display prices and irked at having to go from their local Apple Store to the CompUSA down the road to get a cheap off-brand 17&#8221; <span class="caps"><span class="caps">LCD</span></span>.  But at the end of that littany of minor complaints: <strong>c&#8217;mon.</strong>  This thing is <em>busted sweet</em>.  $499!  Never again will I have to endure some asshat jibing a well-meaning Mac evangelist with &#8220;well, uh, sure they work well and stuff, but, uh, they&#8217;re too expensive!  Yeah!  Snob!&#8221;  And let me probably not be the first to say: an armful of these + <a href="http://www.apple.com/acg/xgrid/">Xgrid</a> + <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/xcode.html">Xcode</a> = <em>best distributed homebrew pr0n scraper e-var</em>.  Or, y&#8217;know, crunching numbers to cure cancer.  That too.</li><br /></ol><br /><br /><p>I hope the market takes to these like they have to the iPod, and that this is a banner year for Apple.  Awesome job, guys n&#8217; gals.</p>
