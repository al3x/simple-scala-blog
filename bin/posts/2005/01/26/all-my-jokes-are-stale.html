<h1>All My &#8220;Ahoy&#8221; Jokes Are Stale</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s a small web development community.  </p><br /><br /><p>Why, who is that shooting up the <a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/">del.icio.us</a> popularity index with a nice <a href="http://www.slash7.com/flashback/2005/01/oreilly_onlamp.html">intro</a> and new blog about Rails?  It&#8217;s none other than the multitalented <a href="http://www.infocookie.com">Amy Hoy</a>, the developer I recommended to my <a href="http://www.picnet.net">last employer</a> when I left consulting for my current gig.  She codes some mean <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PHP</span></span>, edits some, uh, mean English, and bakes a mean cake.  She&#8217;s awesome, and awesome people are automatically attracted to Rails.  Also me.</p><br /><br /><p>It&#8217;s like a fever, Ruby is, spreading.  Some sort ruby red fever.  Crimson, even.  Brick.  Maroon.</p>
