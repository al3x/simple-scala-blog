<h1>Work Together</h1>
<p>My relationship priorities, for reasons I have yet to fully grasp, seem to be meeting a woman who inspires me to both move to &#8211; or at least visit &#8211; another place, and one who inspires me to be more creative.  A woman who inspires me, period.  There&#8217;s more to it.</p><br /><br /><p>In my elaborate fantasy life of How Not To Do Things The Established Way And Still Succeed (which thus far has worked reasonably well) I dream of meeting a woman who would be my partner in all things, someone I could making my living and my home with.  I have a soft spot for stories of couples successful in business, be their business techie, artistic, musical, whatever.  The romantic and pragmatic in me see this as a perfect expression of love: two people able to build their livelihood together.  Moreover, the thought of spending the rest of my working life waiting from 9 to 5 to come home to my love is one of those absurd indignities of modern life I simply want to eschew.</p><br /><br /><p>I&#8217;ve been successful in building a life for myself, perhaps too easily.  I want that shattered by another person.  I want my world thrown into wonderful disarray, and I want to pick up the pieces with someone else.</p><br /><br /><p>Such sentiment is, of course, the privilege of my current comfortable situation and born of naivety, as I&#8217;ve never so much as lived with a partner for an extended period.  But whatever the cause and the circumstance, I can&#8217;t escape the idea.</p>
