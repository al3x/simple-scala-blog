<h1>There&#8217;s Beauty In Her Posting Habits</h1>
<p>I am considering seeking a mate via the blogosphere.  </p><br /><br /><p>Yes, I&#8217;m mostly kidding with this consideration, but it doesn&#8217;t seem any more fatal than online dating.  And hey: it was successful for <a href="http://www.wendyandjoey.com/">Wendy and Joey</a>.  </p><br /><br /><p>The likely physical distance between myself and my interest makes for wonderful escapism: &#8220;did she post today?  She did!  Can I read myself into this?  God but she writes like an angel.  Oh, if only I were <em>there!</em>&#8221;  One could carry himself through many a lonely wintery week in this bastard city on such fluff.</p><br /><br /><p>But in all seriousness, I&#8217;m actually surprised this hasn&#8217;t happened more, or maybe we just don&#8217;t hear about it.  For the generation for whom online dating has become accepted (&#8220;Where&#8217;d you two meet?&#8221; &#8220;Internet.  Where the hell else does anyone meet these days?&#8221;) &#8211; if not celebrated &#8211; it makes about as much sense for those of us uncomfortable with the meat-market creepiness of selecting your match from a list of thumbnails and saccharine answers to inane profile prompts.  A blog may only give you what someone is willing to share about herself, but it gives you <em>more</em> of what she shares.  It is, arguably, a better set of data from which to gauge, presented in a less skewed form and forum.</p><br /><br /><p>But there&#8217;s no protocol for blog romance, in the social and technical senses.  On the social tip, it&#8217;s sleazy to write your favorite blogger and profess your interest; reader-author interaction usually stops at comments, and even there certain limits are typically observed.  On the technical end, there&#8217;s no way to easily find other bloggers who are, if you&#8217;ll excuse the crass phrase, &#8220;on the market,&#8221; though the worth of a mechanism to allow this (TrackLove?  LoveBack?  BabyGotBack?) is highly suspect.</p><br /><br /><p>I&#8217;d be interested to hear of any experiences &#8211; preferably as close to firsthand as possible &#8211; with finding romance via blogs.  If you&#8217;d be so kind as to pass this request on via some stealthy rebloggery I&#8217;d be much obliged.  </p><br /><br /><p>Smitten, even.</p>
