<h1>Coming To Blog Awareness</h1>
<p>In the face of endless rehashed wire stories on the &#8220;explosion of blog readership in America&#8221; the last day or so, Erik <a href="http://nslog.com/archives/2005/01/04/qotd_blog_awareness.php">asks</a>: &#8220;When did you reach &#8216;Blog Awareness?&#8217;&#8221;</p><br /><br /><p>One of the minor regrets I have about this site is that I lack archives from my early days of <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> usage.  My archives here only go back to 2002, but I was &#8220;blogging&#8221; back in 1999 when Blogger first launched.  Of course, even though I was using a service called <em>Blogger</em>, at the time I merely viewed it as an easier way to update my site&#8217;s news page, taking a cue from the design sites I then frequented .  I didn&#8217;t realize I was part of a growing trend or community until mid-2000 when the term started to become pervasive.</p><br /><br /><p>Of course, the true &#8220;old guard&#8221; of bloggers go <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#History">much farther back</a> in the history of the web.  But compared to the current &#8220;explosion,&#8221; I&#8217;m old school.  So, uh, give it up for me.</p>
