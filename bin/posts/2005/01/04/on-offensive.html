<h1>On The Offensive?</h1>
<p>Continuing, much to my dismay, my complaints about horrific background music, I&#8217;m back at Murky VA where, since sitting down half an hour ago, I&#8217;ve been forced to suffer The White Stripes, some bargain basement metal, a now Daft&#8217;s Punk &#8220;One More Time&#8221; played entirely in the wrong spirit and made all the more heinous by baristas maliciously singing along.  The paranoid in me thinks an employee saw my blog and ensured I&#8217;d be tormented as soon as I sat down, but the pragmatist in me knows <em>nobody</em> reads this fucker.</p><br /><br /><p>Maybe I should have purchased earphones with a little more isolation.  Or maybe I should burst my eardrums with a coffee stirrer.</p>
