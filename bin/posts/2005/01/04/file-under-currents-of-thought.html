<h1>File Under: Currents of Thought</h1>
<p>I was startled to see Slashdot post <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/04/0117245&amp;from=rss">this article</a> on <a href="http://www.adammathes.com/academic/computer-mediated-communication/folksonomies.html">&#8220;Folksonomies&#8221;</a> today, as I <a href="http://www.al3x.net/archives/2004/11/14/emergentcollaborative-catagorization/">posted</a> on pretty much the exact same topic back in November.  Like my post, none of the material linked from the Slashdot article actually offered any working code, but it&#8217;s nice to see other people thinking about these problems.</p><br /><br /><p>When talking to a friend about this today I used to following analogy to illustrate what&#8217;s at stake: imagine a massive library full of choice hand-picked books.  Now imagine that library just slaps its books on its shelves like your local used book store, vaguely by topic but with every employee and a few bumbling customers leaving &#8220;History&#8221; in &#8220;American Studies&#8221; and the like.  Think of all the wasted potential in such a well-picked but woefully sorted library.  That&#8217;s what <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>, and their ilk face becoming without some taxonomical intervention, machine-enforced or otherwise.</p><br /><br /><p>Definitely worth thinking about.</p>
