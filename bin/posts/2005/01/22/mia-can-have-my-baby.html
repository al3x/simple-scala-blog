Any girl with a flow like that&#8230; damn.  Check out the video Richard links to for evidence that she&#8217;s as easy on the eyes as the ears.  That smile, that I-don&#8217;t-have-to-dance-like-those-dancehall-hootchies-&#8217;cos-I&#8217;m-the-MC wiggle&#8230;  <em>le sigh</em></p><br /><br /><p>Same goes for all the ladies on <a href="http://www.junglistic-sistaz.com">Junglistic Sistaz</a>.  Totally volunteering to be your baby daddy, right here.</p>
