<h1>Imitates Life</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.questionablecontent.net/">Questionable Content</a> is so dense with references, slang, and characters from my own life that I really want to dislike it.  But I cannot.  It is also dense with humor.  Humors, really.  Geek humor.  Indie rock humor.  Young person relationship humor.  Robot humor.  Anime humor.  Humors.  Read it, and while you&#8217;re at it prepare yourself for the next installment of <a href="http://www.krakowstudios.com">Krakow</a>.</p>
