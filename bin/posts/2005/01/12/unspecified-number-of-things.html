<h1>An Unspecified Number of Things</h1>
<p>I lied.  <a href="http://43things.com/people/view/al3x">43 Things</a>, really.  I&#8217;m not there yet, not nearly, but I do have a number of things I want to do with my special unique snowflake life.  And that&#8217;s what 43 Things does: it lets snowflakes list what they want to do, and correlates those things into a big happy snowshower of life activities.  Browsing it is mildly addictive, but in an inspiring, positive way; it&#8217;s not one of those seedy voyeuristic corners of the net, no sir.  People on 43 Things just want to <a href="http://43things.com/things/view/10782">make sweet love</a>.</p><br /><br /><p>43 Things was built on <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Rails</a>.  Rails delights me in portions of my being that I never knew existed, much less were capable of being delighted by a web application framework.  My infatuation with <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, dormant two long years, has been mightily rekindled by Rails.  I really quite genuinely want to <a href="http://43things.com/things/view/7920">drink a beer or 12</a> with <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>.</p>
