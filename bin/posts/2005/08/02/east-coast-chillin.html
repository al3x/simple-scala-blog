<h1>East Coast Chillin&#8217;</h1>
<p>After ten weeks on the Left Coast I&#8217;m back in the greater DC metro area once again, decompressing for a few days at my folks&#8217; place in Annapolis.  It feels great to be back home.  I feel like I&#8217;m looking at the place through the fresh lens.</p><br /><br /><p>DefCon in general and <a href="https://www.kenshoto.com">our</a> Capture The Flag in particular went great.  I&#8217;ll have lots to post on that in days to come, once I have it all sorted out in my head.</p><br /><br /><p>I should be back in Northern VA this coming weekend, and moving the following weekend.  Holler at me if you&#8217;d like to meet up.</p>
