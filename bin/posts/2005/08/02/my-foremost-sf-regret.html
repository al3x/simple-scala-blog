<h1>My Foremost SF Regret</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ll miss the beautiful weather.  I&#8217;ll miss Tacqueria Can-Cun, my superbly grumpy pho place in Sunset, and all the other great food.  I&#8217;ll miss people being outwardly friendly, if often disingenuous.  But my one big regret is that I left San Francisco without getting some serious work done by artist <a href="http://jasontylergrace.com/bodyart.asp">Jason Tyler Grace</a>.</p><br /><br /><p>Grace, from the work of his that I&#8217;ve seen, is phenomenal.  His blacks are deep, sharp, and clean.  His colors &#8211; particularly at the warm end of the spectrum &#8211; are vibrant and expertly mixed.  Most of all, his pieces are confidently executed, even when bringing together the sort of detail that most artists couldn&#8217;t even manage in a creative sandbox like Photoshop, much less permanently embedded into flesh.</p><br /><br /><p>More of his work can be seen in the Guardian&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bestofthebay.com/2005/gall.php?i=2#GUT">Best of the Bay 2005</a> tattoo special.  I&#8217;d consider going back to SF in a year or two just to have him work on me.</p>
