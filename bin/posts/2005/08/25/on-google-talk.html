<h1>On Google Talk</h1>
<p>Thankfully, Wired News already <a href="http://wired.com/news/print/0,1294,68642,00.html">wrote pretty much what I was going to</a> about <a href="http://talk.google.com">Google Talk</a>.  In short, it&#8217;s so rudimentary that it almost doesn&#8217;t matter.</p><br /><br /><p>It&#8217;s disappointing that Google continuously treats Mac users as second-class citizens, and the Windows-only Talk is no exception.  Sure, it&#8217;s just a Jabber server, and I can chat with Talk users via iChat, Adium, or the like.  Doing so means I can&#8217;t take advantage of Talk&#8217;s voice chat, however, and that&#8217;s its only advanced feature.</p><br /><br /><p>I could see Talk getting interesting if their next version works on multiple platforms, actually has significant interface improvements over other IM clients, and bridges networks (Google Talk &lt;<del>&gt; <span class="caps"><span class="caps">AIM</span></span>, or Google Talk &lt;</del>&gt; <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MSN</span></span>, for example).</p><br /><br /><p>Until then, Google is starting to run the risk of matching Microsoft not only in its behemoth size and pervasiveness, but in the blandness of its offerings as well.  </p>
