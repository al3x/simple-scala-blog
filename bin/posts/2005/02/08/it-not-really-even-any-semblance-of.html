<p>What&#8217;s that you say, [pretty much any goddamn DC blogger]?  You&#8217;ve been listening to [pretty much any goddamn indie album on Pitchfork]?  And they sound like a cross between [band you think is obscure from New York, mid-&#8217;80s] and [other hip indie-pop band for more accessible point-of-reference]?  And you&#8217;re going to make me listen to them and a bunch of shit like them at <a href="http://www.ipodjukebox.com/">iPod DJ Night</a>?</p><br /><br /><p>Well fuck you, cuz.  I&#8217;m going to make you listen to some real grime bizness, some real raw shit.  You <em>don&#8217;t even know</em>.  You won&#8217;t like it, but your girl will.  I&#8217;ma hit that in the bathroom and jet back to the lab and maybe post my playlist <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RIGHT THE FUCK HERE ON THIS BLOG</span></span> when I get there.  I know: you&#8217;re all &#8220;oh shit&#8221; and I&#8217;m all &#8220;[posting to blog sounds, typing I guess].&#8221;</p><br /><br /><p>The above scenario, or I don&#8217;t get there early enough to get a slot and I have a beer and I leave.  Whatever.</p><br /><br /><p>By the by, progress on the new Rails-powered blog engine was healthy this evening.  Believe!</p>
