<h1>The Suburbs Are Killing Us</h1>
<p>Read <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,6000,1418246,00.html">every last word of this</a>, though take it with a grain of salt as warranted by the source.  It may be a voyeuristic scare story to shake up smart Brits over Sunday breakfast, but its author puts his finger on what&#8217;s so broken in America.</p><br /><br /><p>Living in the suburbs feels dishonest for me, every day.  The libertarian in me says, &#8220;let people live that way, as long as I don&#8217;t have to,&#8221; and I look desperately at Craigslist apartment prices in cities far and near.  But that&#8217;s wrong.  Someone living in an exurb still effects all the people who move to cities and try to forget there&#8217;s such a thing as sprawl.  We&#8217;re all on the same sociopolitical grid, as it were, and as long as you care about other people you can&#8217;t dissociate from it.</p><br /><br /><p>Link from Phil&#8217;s <a href="http://del.icio.us/philleif">del.icio.us</a>, and post title in full knowledge of <a href="http://www.christopherporter.com/">this fine music blogger</a>.</p>
