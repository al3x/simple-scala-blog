<h1>ShmooCon</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ll be at <a href="http://www.shmoocon.org/">Shmoocon</a> this weekend.</p><br /><br /><p>I&#8217;m a little burned out on hacker cons, but Shmoocon &#8211; being located right here in DC, put on by friends and colleagues, and free to me thanks to a pass handout &#8220;for the community&#8221; at a 2600 meeting a few months back &#8211; requires such infinitesimal effort and outlay of resources on my part that I have no excuse but to go.</p><br /><br /><p>Say &#8220;die&#8221; if you&#8217;re around.  I&#8217;ll be blogging interesting panels as I see fit and as connectivity permits.</p>
