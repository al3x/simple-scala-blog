<h1>Hosting 4 Life (In Gang Letters, Across Chest)</h1>
<p>I like the place this site is hosted at now, I really do.  Good people, interesting technology, fair price and a discount for Open Source geeks.  But I&#8217;ve been hearing wonderful things about TextDrive, and I love their attitude and entrepreneurial spirit.  I identify.  If I were going to run a hosting company, it would be like TextDrive only a little less about Content Management Systems and a little more about security.  It&#8217;d be, like, SecureDrive.  TextLock&#8230; Drive.  InfoCom.  Tech.</p><br /><br /><p>Right.  So.  I saw that TextDrive is offering a <a href="http://textdrive.com/vctwo">very sharp promotion</a> to get some rapid funding: <em>lifetime</em> service for a flat fee.  You give them a chunk of operating cash and they give you hosting as long as their doors are open.  Even if they&#8217;re only around for the next year (knock on wood), I still save about US$10 a month over my current deal.  Plus, 10% of that chunk of cash goes to the Open Source project of my choice, which of course I put towards <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>.</p><br /><br /><p>What do I lose?  Dedicated hosting, albeit virtual dedicated hosting.  It&#8217;s nice to have root, but it&#8217;s also nice to make it someone else&#8217;s problem when things blow up.  And given how on top of cutting edge hosting technologies TextDrive is, the only odd request I&#8217;ll probably be making is for my absurdly low SpamAssassin threshold (break 2.5 and it don&#8217;t jive, baby).</p><br /><br /><p>I&#8217;ll be moving all this lot over in a few days but you shouldn&#8217;t even notice (this site has moved hosts more times than I can even count; so, like, four).  Woo for small business, Open Source, &#8220;the community,&#8221; et cetera.</p>
