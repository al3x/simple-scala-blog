<h1>The Switch</h1>
<p>If you catch me on <span class="caps"><span class="caps">AIM</span></span> in the next couple weeks my responses may be slow.  Really slow.</p><br /><br /><p>Thanks to the <a href="http://dvzine.org">Dvorak Zine</a>, which I picked up from one of its authors at the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SPX</span></span> this past weekend, I&#8217;ve seen the light and am making the switch to Dvorak.  It&#8217;s not about speed, but about comfort.  Typing Dvorak makes sense; it just feels right.</p><br /><br /><p>Learning is slow going.  I touch-typed 100+ words per minute on <span class="caps"><span class="caps">QWERTY</span></span>, and I don&#8217;t expect that back soon.  Typing slowly is allowing my aching hands to heal, however, so I&#8217;m taking it in stride. </p><br /><br /><p>That took forever to type.  Whew.</p>
