<h1>SPX MTHRFKR!</h1>
<p>This weekend is the <a href="http://www.spxpo.com/">Small Press Expo</a> in my home town of Bethesda, MD.  I&#8217;m going for the first time in several years.  The exhibitors include far more webcomics than I remember, but I&#8217;ve got no qualms with that.</p><br /><br /><p>At the last <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SPX I</span></span> went to I got to have <a href="http://www.spxpo.com/">Chynna</a> sign one of my Bleu Monday books, and I met <a href="http://www.brianwood.com">Brian Wood</a> when his seminal Channel Zero was just out.  It was awesome.  Not your average comic con.</p><br /><br /><p>I&#8217;m going with <a href="http://www.steeltoe.org">Ben</a>.  Join us, won&#8217;t you?</p>
