<h1>Upgrade</h1>
<p>I haven&#8217;t killed the blog.  In fact, I upgraded to a newer version of <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/">Typo</a> this evening.  I&#8217;m not crazy about Typo, but now&#8217;s not the time to write yet another <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DIY</span></span> blog engine.</p><br /><br /><p>The stylesheet included in Typo&#8217;s default theme was an absolute mess, and 90% of the time spent upgrading was cleaning it up to make my own &#8220;theme.&#8221;  The site should look mostly like it did before.  Let me know if stuff&#8217;s broken for you.</p><br /><br /><p>Comments and trackbacks are both enabled, as Typo claims to have excellent comment spam protection.</p><br /><br /><p>The best advice I got on whether or not to ditch the blog was:</p><br /><br /><blockquote><br />    <p>&#8220;you don&#8217;t seem to have any cause or focus (music, media, politics, dc culture) that any other blogs cover, and if you don&#8217;t have time to find one, why torture yourself?</p><br /><br />    <p>&#8220;you don&#8217;t allow comments, which makes it harder to create a community around yours and the writings/rants of your friends on their blogs (if they do such a thing).</p><br /><br />    <p>&#8220;so either write about things you want (music, technology, etc etc) and let people discuss them, link to relevant discussions, and foster the community that I know you like the theory of, or just create another vanity webpage.&#8221;</p><br /></blockquote><br /><br /><p>I haven&#8217;t really decided what to do with said advice, but there it is.</p>
