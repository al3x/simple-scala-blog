<h1>Deliver A Favor</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.coheedandcambria.com">Coheed and Cambria</a>, pretty much my favorite band to sing along to, is on tour with the <a href="http://www.thebloodbrothers.com">Blood Brothers</a>, pretty much my favorite band to scream along to.  They&#8217;re playing two shows in the DC area in November.  The first is on Saturday the 5th at <a href="http://www.sonar.us">Sonar</a> in Baltimore.  The second is Monday the 7th at the <a href="http://www.930.com">9:30 Club</a>.</p><br /><br /><p>I have one ticket to each.  None of my friends are fans of either band, so I will go alone.  Last year Co&amp;Ca played the 9:30 Club the day after my 21st birthday, and I got to smugly drink a Guiness whilst the kiddies moshed about.  Good times.</p><br /><br /><p>At any rate, if you&#8217;re also going to these shows, you should let me know.  We can be all, &#8220;I really enjoy the Coheed &amp; Cambria comic book, no matter how nerdy it is.  Songs about intergalactic war are awesome.&#8221;</p><br /><br /><p>And so forth.</p>
