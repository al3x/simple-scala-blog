<h1>Easter</h1>
<p>Easter is when zombie Jesus rises from his grave to feed on the brains (and souls) of the living.  </p><br /><br /><p>Every Easter we eat many Marshmallow Peeps and Cadbury Cream Eggs in a desperate attempt to keep our blood sugar levels high enough that we can stay awake until the Easter horror is gone after seemingly endless hours of guarding the reinforced doors to our homes with nary but a shotgun and the wish to live another day.</p><br /><br /><p>My religious education was exceedingly poor.</p><br /><br /><p>Happy Easter.</p>
