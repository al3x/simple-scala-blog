<h1>Uh, hi.</h1>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t even noticed that the iTunes flirting story got posted to Kottke, Lifehacker, et al. until my friendly neighborhood <a href="http://www.justagwailo.com/">gwailo</a> emailed me with the poignant observation: &#8220;the people [commenting on that post] don&#8217;t appear to have actually read the last part[,] do they?&#8221;</p><br /><br /><p>If you just found my site via one of those links: hi, my name&#8217;s al3x, and iTunes <strong>didn&#8217;t get me a date</strong>.  It didn&#8217;t get me so much as a real life, flesh and blood, face-to-face conversation.  The whole point of that post was that this supposedly &#8220;social&#8221; technology engendered nothing more than your typical detached chat room or IM conversation, even though both participants were no more than 15 feet away.  Even the ever-so-slight cloak of anonymity inherent in virtual identity was enough to prevent a meaningful real-world social interaction.  That was the point.</p><br /><br /><p>That&#8217;s just how it worked for me, though.  Chatting via iTunes library title is a technique (a, uh, &#8220;lifehack&#8221; <em>cough</em>), and there&#8217;s always someone out there who can implement your technique better (ie, use it to get a date).  Good luck to that enterprising soul.</p>
