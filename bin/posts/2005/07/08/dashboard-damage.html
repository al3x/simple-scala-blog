<h1>Dashboard&#8217;s Damage</h1>
<p>I have a love-hate relationship with Mac <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X 10</span></span>.4&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/">Dashboard</a>.</p><br /><br /><p>On the one hand, it&#8217;s nice to have the weather, a calculator, a calendar, my upcoming iCal events, the time in DC, a fast way to post to del.icio.us, a sticky note, a unit converter, a dictionary/thesaurus, and the Ruby core library reference no more than a keystroke or hot corner away.</p><br /><br /><p>On the other hand, I had all of these things before.  While I appreciate Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Dashboard_Tutorial/Overview/chapter_2_section_4.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001340-CH202-DontLinkElementID_27">strict and clear Dashboard programming guide</a> for what it suggests widgets should be, it isn&#8217;t strict enough.</p><br /><br /><p>Widgets should not be task-redundant.  The world does not need hundreds of widgets that do nothing but fetch and display an <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSS</span></span> feed.  This is Dashboard&#8217;s major offense: it encourages people away from well-rounded solutions and towards brittle and overly-simplistic ones.  A weather widget is good; people need to glance at a weather report.  A <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/transportation/googlemapswidget.html">Google Maps widget</a> is bad; why break off a subset of that exceptional site&#8217;s features into a constrained viewable area when the whole thing can be a bookmark away?</p><br /><br /><p>Widgets are defined in contrast to applications in the aforementioned programmer&#8217;s guide, but in reality many widgets are bite-sized chunks of <em>web</em> applications.  Apple should add a new strong suggestion to that document: don&#8217;t duplicate any functionality that&#8217;s better served by a real website.</p><br /><br /><p>Dashboard is also in desperate need of a seamless widget update mechanism.  Widgets downloaded from Apple&#8217;s directory should be upgraded automatically at a user-configurable interval; you should &#8220;subscribe&#8221; to a widget, in effect.  Keeping up with a dozen widgets on top of my arsenal of applications is a bear.</p><br /><br /><p>The feature&#8217;s memory consumption is criminal.  Thanks almost singlehandedly to Dashboard, Tiger does <strong>not</strong> feel faster than Panther on my amply-equipped PowerBook G4.  This is the first downgrade in perceived performance from release-to-release since the earliest versions of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span>.</p><br /><br /><p>Overall, it&#8217;s the sort of gimmicky feature I wouldn&#8217;t have expected Apple to bring to market.  I hope the next iteration of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span> focuses on more substantive improvements.  In the meantime, I keep toying with the idea of <a href="http://face.centosprime.com/macosxw/?p=201">turning the damn thing off</a>.</p>
