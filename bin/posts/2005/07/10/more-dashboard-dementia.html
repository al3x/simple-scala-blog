<h1>More Dashboard Dementia</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m not alone in my <a href="http://al3x.net/articles/2005/07/08/dashboard-s-damage">Dashboard-bashing</a>.</p><br /><br /><p>Leon Breedt <a href="http://blog.xeraph.org/articles/2005/07/10/take-back-your-latency">suggests</a>:</p><br /><br /><blockquote><br />    <p>Turn off Dashboard with <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/18261,performance">DashOnOff</a> and notice<br />    how you get real-time typing back. I want to<br />    say Ì?å¢Ì¢‰??åÂÌ?‰??WooÌ?å¢Ì¢‰??åÂ? but IÌ?å¢Ì¢‰??åÂÌ¢‰??å¢m not sure its that much of<br />    an achievement when it should not have<br />    been an issue to start with :)</p><br /><br />    <p>It canÌ?å¢Ì¢‰??åÂÌ¢‰??å¢t have been memory, my PowerBook was<br />    never thrashing (and it has 1.5GB of memory,<br />    more than my desktop PC, constantly hovering<br />    at around 700MB free, even with Dashboard).</p><br /><br />    <p>Now IÌ?å¢Ì¢‰??åÂÌ¢‰??å¢m wondering if it was a rogue widget, or<br />    if Dashboard just likes the taste of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPU</span></span> in<br />    the morning.  </p><br /></blockquote><br /><br /><p>The thing is, Leon shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about &#8220;rogue widgets&#8221; eating his machine alive.  Apple should have built the walls on the Dashboard sandbox high enough that all the little widgets can&#8217;t hurt themselves &#8211; or anyone else.</p><br /><br /><p>Andrew Orlowski of the Register relays <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/05/26/tiger_ui_review/">more concerns</a>, albeit with a grain of salt:</p><br /><br /><blockquote><br />    <p>On Apple&#8217;s own support boards, concern<br />    about the performance impact of Dashboard<br />    is widely expressed. But this is overstated, and<br />    isn&#8217;t the real issue with Dashboard.<br />    (With 30MB free memory &#8211; on a machine with<br />    1.5GB of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RAM</span></span> &#8211; Dashboard claims half of what&#8217;s<br />    available when invoked. It doesn&#8217;t matter how<br />    many widgets are active. The memory is slowly<br />    reclaimed by the garbage collector, and this<br />    compares very favorably with Konfabulator, a<br />    clunky rip-off of Stardock&#8217;s DesktopX product<br />    for Windows.) </p><br /></blockquote><br /><br /><p>That&#8217;s two voices suggesting that Dashboard isn&#8217;t a memory hog.  All I know is, flipping the switch in DashOnOff freed up 200MB.  It&#8217;s like having a new machine.  Or at least like having Panther back.  Orlowski then gets to the nitty-gritty of the Dashboard folly:</p><br /><br /><blockquote><br />    <p>The real issue with Dashboard is that it&#8217;s a<br />    solution looking for a problem. We&#8217;ve had<br />    equivalents such as Desktop X and Konfabulator<br />    for several years now, and they&#8217;ve yielded<br />    thousands of clocks, media controllers and<br />    dancing Hula girls. Shed the gimmicks and<br />    redundant applications and what&#8217;s left isn&#8217;t<br />    too different from the set of desk accessories<br />    that shipped with the original Mac.</p><br /></blockquote><br /><br /><p>Regardless, killing Dashboard forced me to refine my workflow.  I was already consolidating more activities into Safari: <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSS</span></span> reading, fast searching via <a href="http://haoli.dnsalias.com/Saft/">Saft</a> shortcuts, using bookmarklets for things like easy del.icio.us additions.  Now I&#8217;ve gone back to peppering my toolbar bookmarks with shortcuts to the sort of information I was checking regularly with Dashboard, like a local weather report.  And you know what?  Being able to see detailed information on the day&#8217;s weather without clicking through from a widget to Safari is just better.  Or at the very least, it&#8217;s not <em>redundant</em>.</p><br /><br /><p>Rather than half-assing my note-taking with the deplorably limited sticky widget I&#8217;m now getting more out of <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">QuickSilver</a> and its Text Manipulation Actions plugin, judiciously taking notes via a workflow like this:</p><br /><br /><ol><br /><li>Bring up QuickSilver.</li><br /><li>Hit &#8221;.&#8221; (period) to bring up an input field.</li><br /><li>Type my note.</li><br /><li>Tab to actions and navigate to &#8220;Append to&#8230;&#8221;</li><br /><li>Tab to items and choose the &#8220;Scratch.txt&#8221; document that I&#8217;ve explicitly added to the QuickSilver catalog.</li><br /></ol><br /><br /><p>It&#8217;s five steps, but damned if it takes more than a couple seconds once you have it down.  The next time I want my notes I flip over to <a href="http://www.macromates.com/">TextMate</a> &#8211; which stays open most of the time &#8211; and check out Scratch.txt, which I keep in a broader &#8220;Notes&#8221; project.  If I just want to get there by the content of my notes I can always use Spotlight.  Or hell, I could use QuickSilver to get to the file.  No matter how I do it, it fits a familiar workflow, not zooming me off to the magical Dashboard realm of tiny applications that obey few rules and behave as they will.</p><br /><br /><p>While rounding out my Dashboard-free setup I&#8217;ve come to re-appreciate just how brilliant <a href="http://www.iconfactory.com/ip_home.asp">iPulse</a> is (I know <a href="http://holeinthebox.com/">Scott</a> is with me on this).  One glance at the Dock or flip of Expose&#8217;s &#8220;reveal desktop&#8221; hot corner and I&#8217;ve got a compact yet informative view of most everything going on with my system.  iPulse doesn&#8217;t eat <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RAM</span></span> or chew <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPU</span></span> cycles.  Best of all, its elegance is decidedly Mac-like: a better way to display complex and &#8220;un-humane&#8221; information.</p><br /><br /><p>Ultimately, I didn&#8217;t mean to suggest in my last post on this topic that Apple shipped <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X 10</span></span>.4 at the expense of quality features.  There are superb and well-concieved improvements all over Tiger, and even Dashboard was an answer to some demand and interest from the Mac community.  It&#8217;s undeniable, however, that Tiger is a step down from Panther in terms of overall quality control, riddled as it is with interface inconsistencies and odd performance issues.</p><br /><br /><p>Dashboard may have its place for some users, but its development should have taken a back seat to resolving more substantial problems.  Apple has always been about balancing innovation with quality.  I don&#8217;t want to see that change.</p>
