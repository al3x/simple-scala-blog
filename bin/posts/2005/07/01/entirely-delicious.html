<h1>Entirely del.icio.us</h1>
<p>If you <a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/al3x">subscribe</a> to <a href="http://del.icio.us/al3x">my del.icio.us</a> you might have seen a couple hundred new links go by the other night.  That&#8217;s because I moved all non-personal bookmarks over to the social linking service in a blizzard of tagging and carpal tunnel.</p><br /><br /><p>Thanks to the del.icio.us plugin for <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> all those URLs are now far more available than when they were tucked away in Safari&#8217;s bookmarks menu.</p><br /><br /><p>Plus, sharing.  Aww.</p>
