<h1>Firefox Fix</h1>
<p>Apparently readers using Firefox haven&#8217;t been seeing the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CSS</span></span>-styled version of this site since I moved to Typo.  My server was sending the stylesheet as an octet stream and Firefox don&#8217;t play that way.  Safari didn&#8217;t mind, so I didn&#8217;t notice.</p><br /><br /><p>It&#8217;s fixed.  Just had to set the css <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MIME</span></span> type in <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">lighttpd</a>.</p>
