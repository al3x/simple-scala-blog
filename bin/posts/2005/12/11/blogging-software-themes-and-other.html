<h1>Blogging Software, Themes, and Other Detrius</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ve not posted a number of days because I&#8217;m in a <strong>state</strong>.  A familiar state.  A state that&#8217;s best summed-up as &#8220;unwilling to post to my blog because I hate my blog software and adding more posts to the database means more content to migrate when I pick or write a new one.&#8221;</p><br /><br />    <p>Right now, the content you&#8217;re (hopefully) reading is managed by <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com">Typo</a>.  Typo runs on <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>.  Both my old host, <a href="http://www.textdrive.com">Textdrive</a> and my new host, <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a>, claim support for Rails.  They say, &#8220;come, use Rails and Rails applications like Typo on our shared servers, and it will be good.&#8221;</p><br /><br />    <p>It is not good.</p><br /><br />    <p>Look, I don&#8217;t want to bash the popular kid.  Rails is tasty-sweet, a great fit for certain kinds of projects.  But it, and the components it relies on like FastCGI and, well, Ruby, need some work.  They&#8217;re unstable.  They leak.  They eat servers for breakfast.</p><br /><br />    <p>Now, I don&#8217;t mind doing some application tweaking and handholding when in a complex production scenario.  But Typo is a <em>blog engine</em>.  It goes &#8220;here&#8217;s some posts&#8230; Hey, that one has a comment! Oh, lemme post that via <span class="caps"><span class="caps">XML</span></span>-RPC for you, sir! And how about those session cookies?&#8221;  That&#8217;s all it does.  That&#8217;s all it needs to do.</p><br /><br />    <p><strong>I shouldn&#8217;t need to be a full-time administrator for my blog software.</strong>  I shouldn&#8217;t need to tweak a damn thing to have it run acceptably in a shared hosting environment.  And it certianly shouldn&#8217;t consume so many resources that I&#8217;m (rightly!) getting nasty notes from my hosting provider.</p><br /><br />    <p>I&#8217;ve actually got half a mind to switch back to <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>.  Oh, sure, it&#8217;s <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PHP</span></span> and <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PHP</span></span> sucks and it&#8217;s insecure and it&#8217;s the third largest target for blog spam on the entire Internet, but it <em>works</em>.  It&#8217;s speedy.  The 2.0 release candidate is a-okay.</p><br /><br />    <p>I&#8217;m going to hold off on switching, however, until WordPress 2.0 is released and abused; that is, until 2.0.1 is out.  That should be enough time for the right honorable Kyle Neath to release his <a href="http://warpspire.com/journal/personal/introducing-hemingway/">Hemmingway</a>  theme for WordPress.  It&#8217;s presently a Typo theme &#8211; the <em>best</em> Typo theme &#8211; and he was nice enough to write me back and suggest it&#8217;d be ported by sometime in December.  I&#8217;ll shift it over to my usual &#8220;sad cloud&#8221; color scheme, but damn it looks good.  I&#8217;d been mulling over a similar design, something close to Steve Smith&#8217;s <a href="http://orderedlist.com">Ordered List</a>, and stumbling across Hemmingway totally made my day.</p><br /><br />    <p>Now, I thought about writing my own blog engine in <a href="http://www.djangoproject.org">Django</a>.  In fact, it&#8217;s basically done, in no small part because Django&#8217;s generic views mean you hardly have to write a damn thing.  But Django is still undergoing seismic shifts in its codebase, and I&#8217;ve had enough trouble running pre-1.0 web frameworks on shared hosts via FastCGI.  There&#8217;s also nothing custom that I&#8217;m really jonesing for; I just want to set the thing up, made it look perdy, and forget about it so I can write.</p><br /><br />    <p>Which brings us back to my state. I&#8217;ll shake it off.  I&#8217;ll write, even if I have to move the new posts over by hand, through a sea of broken glass and <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SQL</span></span> statements.  I&#8217;ll do this thing becuase I care about <strong>you</strong>, dear reader.</p><br /><br />    <p><3.</p>
