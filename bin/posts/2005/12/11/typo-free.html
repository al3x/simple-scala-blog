<h1>Typo-Free</h1>
<p>A friend recently said to me something to the effect of: &#8220;if there&#8217;s two things you&#8217;re never happy with, it&#8217;s blog software and jobs.&#8221;  Ain&#8217;t it the truth.</p><br /><br />    <p>I&#8217;d had just about a bloody &#8216;nuff of Typo, what with constant errors and crippled non-cache performance and the like.  So I wrote a lil&#8217; script that&#8217;ll export your Typo blog to the plain text Moveable Type export format, and threw the whole mess into <a href="http://www.textpattern.com">TextPattern</a>.</p><br /><br />    <p>Yeah, TextPattern.  Made by Dean Allen.  The TextDrive guy.  The &#8220;Text&#8221; in TextDrive, really.  If ever there was evidence that my beef with TextDrive isn&#8217;t personal, I&#8217;d say this is it.  Short of maybe a card.  On nice stationary.</p><br /><br />    <p>TextPattern is good.  It&#8217;s simple, faster than <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, well-written for being <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PHP</span></span>, and friendly with shared hosting environments.  I took some time porting <a href="http://hemingway.textdriven.com/">Hemingway</a>, tweaking it and making the colors just so.  I&#8217;m happy with the way the whole lot looks on your end and works on my end.  Hopefully you dig the look too.</p><br /><br />    <p>Redirects have been put in place for the feeds, and I&#8217;ll get around to doing the same for the articles.</p>
