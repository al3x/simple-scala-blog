<h1>Sync My Wiki (Not a Filthy Euphemism)</h1>
<p>I ostensibly use <a href="http://www.instiki.org">Instiki</a> for Wiki-tastic personal organization.  Ostensibly, but not really, &#8216;cause I&#8217;m paralyzed by the fear of adding something to the Instiki instance on my PowerBook and not having it available on my remote server, and vice versa.  I would really love a way to sync two Instiki instances, even via something kludgey and Unixy like ssh+rsync.  If the LazyWeb does not provide for me by, say, next weekend I&#8217;ll write it my damn self.</p>
