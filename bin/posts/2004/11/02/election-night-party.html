<h1>Election Night Party</h1>
<p>I will be at the <a href="http://redefeatbush.com/index.php">ReDefeat Bush</a> party on Election night, a sullen independent in a sea of enthused and expectant liberals.  I&#8217;ll be the one wearing the Kerry-Edwards pin.  Ha-ha.</p><br /><br /><p>If you&#8217;re a US citizen of voting age: vote.  Then come drink.  Preferably in that order.</p>
