<h1>Artomatic</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.artomatic.org">Artomatic</a> is a subject of some contention in DC.  The premise: take a big hokin&#8217; old building and fill it with a shit-ton of art by local artists.  Any art goes, from traditional paintings and sketches to installations and new media.  I went last year for a musical event, not so much for the art.  Ditto this year.</p><br /><br /><p>Actually, I went this year to meet a girl.  A young lady showed up to last Sunday&#8217;s <a href="http://panicresearch.com/electric_poss.html">Electric Possible</a> and danced her way through <a href="http://www.5dots.net/">Craig</a>&#8217;s hip-hop/jungle mashup set.  Charmed as always by any girl who gets down to jungle, I struck up a conversation and later departed with the suggestion that I&#8217;d run into her at a performance taking place last night, the opening night of Artomatic.  She never showed.  C&#8217;est la vie (and, well, art girls).</p><br /><br /><p>I saw but a fraction of what was on display last night, but it seemed pretty much like last year: mostly amateur bullshit.  Some DC bloggers have been in a bunch over Post art critic Blake Gopnick&#8217;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A41463-2004Nov10.html">diss</a> on the event, but for all the strained dentist metaphors, homeboy&#8217;s dead right.  Gopnick comes off like an asshole and a snob for saying it, but he&#8217;s right: the historical means by which great art has been selected, financed, and presented to the public has <em>worked</em>; community showcases and &#8220;experimental spaces&#8221; only endorse an echo chamber in which mediocre artists are supported by their peers and not challenged by higher cultural standards and market realities.  </p><br /><br /><p>Or, put another way: you end up with a honkin&#8217; big building filled with a shit-ton of crappy art.  And blah blah blah paid for with public funds blah blah whinge.</p><br /><br /><p>On the other hand, if you expect the absolute worst &#8211; nothing but torturously conceptual/confrontational installations, let&#8217;s say &#8211; you&#8217;ll be pleasantly surprised, as my friends were last night.  The pieces on display at Artomatic may make you wince, roll your eyes, and drop a pithy comment or sixty, but it&#8217;s all pretty harmless and people are mostly pleasant and it&#8217;s not a bad way to kill a couple hours for free.  So drop by, I say, &#8216;cause what the hell else is your bored ass gonna do?</p><br /><br /><p>And if you see a girl dancing to jungle there, tell her that the al3x ship has <em>sailed</em>, babycakes, and her no-showin&#8217; ass is forever stranded on the Island of Lonely Spinsters.  Straight up.</p>
