<p>I&#8217;ve been on the Interweb for A Long Goddamn Time, relatively speaking.  Wishlists have been around for not so much of that Long Goddamn Time, but long enough that you&#8217;d think I would&#8217;ve used them at some point.  Not the case.</p><br /><br /><p>Yesterday <a href="http://www.diepunyhumans.com/">Warren</a> linked to <a href="http://doctorpepper.keenspace.com/">The Doctor Pepper Show</a>, which instantly floored me.  It&#8217;s drawn by a teenage anime geek girl, the kind you&#8217;d expect to have an <a href="http://www.livejournal.com">LJ</a>, and <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=pepper_maid">does</a>, and by extension the kind you&#8217;d expect to have an Amazon wishlist, but didn&#8217;t.</p><br /><br /><p>So I emailed her.  I said &#8220;I&#8217;ve never ever been moved to give someone a random something for making good content, but your content makes me want to do this thing.&#8221;  And she made <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/27YEM4OU2SZRE/104-6634387-7885558?">a wishlist</a>.  And I bought her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1856693910/qid=1101681062/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-5179732-3537757?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">this book I have and enjoy and can vouch for</a>.  It was a simple, satisfying social transaction.</p><br /><br /><p>Her comic is brilliant.  It does things with the comic book/manga format I&#8217;ve never seen, and some things I had seen but not seen enough of.  It&#8217;s messed up in the best way.  It makes me eyes happy.  It brought me to patronage.  That is what good content does.</p>
