<h1>Pf Outside OpenBSD</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://nedbsd.nl/~ppostma/pf-lkm.html">availability</a> of <a href="http://www.benzedrine.cx/pf.html">pf</a> as a loadable NetBSD kernel module brings me hope of one day, in the not too distant future, running pf on FreeBSD production servers.  And there would be much rejoicing.</p><br /><br /><p>If you &lt;3 pf like I &lt;3 pf, check out the O&#8217;Reilly <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2004/04/15/pf_developers.html">interview</a> (and <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2004/05/06/pf_developers.html">part 2</a>) with some of the core devs working to make packet filtering/scrubbing/mangling that much better.</p>
