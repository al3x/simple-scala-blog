<h1>The New Place</h1>
<p>We&#8217;re very much moved in.  </p><br /><br /><p>I&#8217;m sitting right now in our lovely living/dining room &#8211; the living end all light and white and natural, the dining end all red and black &#8211; and marveling at just how odd it is that this is my home, and my only home.  All things to my name in this world are in this apartment.  That&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve been all in one place in some time.</p><br /><br /><p>I drove home last night from my last exam at <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UMBC</span></span> on the Baltimore-Washington parkway, the sun setting, the early summer air full of the smells of wet earth, dung, and honeysuckle.  For all the pleasure of being able to walk and Metro around the city, I&#8217;ve come to love the long drive between DC and Baltimore.</p><br /><br /><p>I&#8217;ve written little lately because of the confusions of moving, starting a new full-time job, and so forth.  But it&#8217;s all settling down, and I&#8217;ll be back to regular blogging.</p>
