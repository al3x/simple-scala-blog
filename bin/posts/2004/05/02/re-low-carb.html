<h1>Re-Low-Carb&#8217;ing</h1>
<p>A few weeks back I gave up the Atkins ways I\&#8217;d adopted at the turn of the year.  I had lost weight, to be sure, but I felt like crap for all the fat I was consuming; bacon gets gross fast, no question.  I dropped the diet and tried just winging it, hoping I\&#8217;d eat generally healthy, but without a regimen of some sort I quickly found myself consuming junk food and sugar when convenient.  I hadn\&#8217;t put back too much weight, but I felt even worse than when consuming lots of fat and hardly any carbs.</p><br /><br /><p>So, like many Atkins refugees, I jumped ship to South Beach.  I\&#8217;ve been doing that for a week and absolutely love it: all the low-carb effectiveness of Atkins with a sensible attitude towards fat consumption.  Having to avoid sugar is still tough, but the reminder of how lousy I feel when I consume it is generally enough to dissuade me from breaking regimen.</p><br /><br /><p>I\&#8217;ll have more to say after a few more weeks on South Beach.  It seems to be a great diet for people who are either sick of Atkins, or those who don\&#8217;t need to drop a hefty about of heft quickly (ie, you\&#8217;re looking to lose the lovehandles, not the keg).  I fall into both categories (sick of Atkins, just a little weight to loose and keep off), and my initial impressions are very positive</p><br /><br /><p>I will say one thing common to both diets, however: don\&#8217;t get suckered into the various synthetic, artificial low-carb products out there.  The essence of South Beach and Atkins is eating fresh, unprocessed food; low-carb protein bars or bastardized &#8220;low-carb scones&#8221; from a mix are neither fresh nor unprocessed.  So whichever diet you choose, skip most of the Atkins-branded products and their imitators and just eat quality, naturally low-carb food.  You\&#8217;ll feel far better for it.</p><br /><br /><p>So if you\&#8217;re a reader who hangs out with me in meatspace (no pun intended), make sure I don\&#8217;t reach for anything sugary.  Bread I can avoid, beer I can usually turn down, but sugar is my serious weakness.  Having to keep to a diet still seems tacky to me, but it\&#8217;s apparently a tacky necessity I need to get used to.  Thanks a load, lousy genes.</p>
