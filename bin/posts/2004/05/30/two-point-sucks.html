<h1>Two-point-sucks?</h1>
<p>So apparently <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/software/story/0,10801,92934,00.html"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">GNOME 2</span></span>.6 sucks</a> big time?  Anybody have first-hand experience with it?</p><br /><br /><p>I&#8217;ve half a mind to get an x86 box, ironically largely to run VMWare.  Virtual PC is abysmal, even on my PowerBook G4.  I&#8217;m not sure even then how much I&#8217;d use much <span class="caps"><span class="caps">GUI</span></span> stuff &#8211; certainly not the full-on <span class="caps"><span class="caps">GNOME</span></span> desktop.</p>
