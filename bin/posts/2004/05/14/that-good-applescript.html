<h1>That&#8217;s Good AppleScript</h1>
<p>Nice little <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20040512170804933">script</a> over at MacOSXHints that updates your iChat status based on your network connection, either subnet or wireless <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SSID</span></span>.  I&#8217;ve got it set up to report when I&#8217;m at the apartment and when I&#8217;m at the PICnet offices.  Probably not one for the road warriors, but handy.</p>
