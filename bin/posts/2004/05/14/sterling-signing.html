<h1>Sterling Signing</h1>
<p>I think I&#8217;m gonna go see <a href="http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/sterling/index.blog?entry_id=312175">Bruce Sterling</a> talk in Arlington tonight and hopefully get my copy of his latest, &#8220;The Zenith Angle,&#8221; signed.  I&#8217;ll take notes on his talk and post them here.  </p><br /><br /><p>If you&#8217;re curious and in the DC Metro area note that the venue (Olsson&#8217;s bookstore) is right across the street from the Courthouse station on the Orange Line.  If you&#8217;re going to be there, give me a shout.  I&#8217;ll be one of about ten guys with glasses in black t-shirts with PowerBooks, I&#8217;m guessing.</p>
