<h1>It Kinda Does Suck, Sorry</h1>
<p>Try as I might, I just can\&#8217;t get into <a href=http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml"">BBEdit</a>, supposedly the king-hell text editor for the Mac.  It\&#8217;s certainly not that the app lacks for <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/features.shtml">features</a>; there\&#8217;s hardly a damn thing it doesn\&#8217;t do, or couldn\&#8217;t be scripted to do.  It\&#8217;s just that despite being &#8220;Mac <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span> native!&#8221; BBEdit feels like a Classic application: ugly, unrefined, just barely taking advantage of the benefits of Cocoa.  I can see how that wouldn\&#8217;t bother anyone who has used it for years, but I left the Mac around early <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS 9</span></span> for Linux, and have a lack of allegiance bordering on loathing for anything from the Classic era.</p><br /><br /><p>So, despite wishing for a few of BBEdit\&#8217;s features, I use <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> for my daily text editing, ignoring its powerful collaborative features and just using it as the damn fine straightforward text editor it is.</p><br /><br /><p>As a Mac-related aside, <a href="http://www.drunkenbatman.com/drunkenblog-archives/000257.html">Rhapsody in Yellow</a> is an incredible history/opinion piece on Apple\&#8217;s attempts to modernize their developer environment and operating systems, where they\&#8217;ve been and where they should be going in one man\&#8217;s view.  Whether you agree with his idea that Apple should be moving more towards (back towards?) cross-platform compatibility, there\&#8217;s plenty of juicy info in there.  </p><br /><br /><p>The piece left me a little depressed about Apple\&#8217;s overall standing in the development market, but I\&#8217;m lucky enough to be one of the developers he mentions that can develop relatively platform-independent software on my Mac even though most of my users are on Windows and other platforms.  I\&#8217;ve come to love <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span> so much that I often wonder if I\&#8217;d be as passionate about working in/with technology if I didn\&#8217;t have such a gorgeous working environment; <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span> and the hardware it elegantly runs on is, for me, the equivalent of a really nice office I get to come to every day.  If Apple and <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span> slid into the sea tomorrow I guess I\&#8217;d go back to running Gentoo on a nice-ish workhorse x86 laptop, probably a <a href="http://webshop.fujitsupc.com/fpc/Ecommerce/buildseriesbean.do?series=S7">Fujitsu LifeBook <span class="caps"><span class="caps">S7000</span></span></a> or a ThinkPad of some sort, but I wouldn\&#8217;t be happy about it.</p>
