<h1>Food Blogging</h1>
<p>Phil has been <a href="http://superfuturecity.com/">blogging</a> photos of what he and I are cooking in our <a href="http://superfuturecity.com/archives/000044.html">beautiful kitchen</a>.  I&#8217;ll probably be doing the same with stuff I cook for myself.</p><br /><br /><p>Tonight we made marinaded steaks under the broiler, herb salad with bleu cheese dressing, onion bread pudding with gruyere, and a fresh ginger and peach cobbler.  Cooking rules.</p>
