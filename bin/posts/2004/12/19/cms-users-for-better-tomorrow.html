<p>Political Wire reblogs The Register&#8217;s report of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">KE04</span></span> head of online communications Zach Exley&#8217;s <a href="http://politicalwire.com/archives/2004/12/19/cool_software_doesnt_win_elections.html">criticism</a> of his party/campaign&#8217;s Internet efforts, and it&#8217;s worth noting.</p><br /><br /><p>The technology powering this year&#8217;s campaigns failed in no small part because it was so self-conscious, so heavily reported-on and talked-about.  If the medium is the message heard, the message transmitted got lost.</p><br /><br /><p>Of course, the message this round of Democrats was transmitting wasn&#8217;t worth hearing anyway.</p>
