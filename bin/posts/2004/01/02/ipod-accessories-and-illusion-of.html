<h1>iPod, Accessories, and The Illusion of Lifestyle Products</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>My 20GB iPod made its way to me today.  I&#8217;ve seen and used plenty of this particular model so it wasn&#8217;t an utter shock, but Apple&#8217;s elegant packaging is always a pleasure.  My music library just exceeds the iPod in size so I was forced to make some decisions about what I take with me, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to miss Vladislav Delay or <em>all three</em> Pole albums on the road.<br /><br /><br /><br />And taking 20GB worth of my music on the road is now quite possible.  I wussed out on installing the P.I.E. auxiliary input adaptor: warnings of ground loop feedback and torn-up dashboards more than offset the affordability of the device.  I instead opted to have an <a href=\"http://www.us.aiwa.com/default.asp?page=products&amp;action=viewProduct&amp;prod=408\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">AIWA CDC</span></span></span>-Z137</a> CD receiver installed in my Civic.  The unit has an auxiliary 1/8&#8221; input on the front faceplate, providing the essential connection between the iPod and the car&#8217;s stereo system.  I tried hooking the whole works up today and the sound is clean and robust, even out of the iPod&#8217;s amplified headphone output.<br /><br /><br /><br />Of course, a line-out solution would be even cleaner, and is supported in the 3G iPod&#8217;s dock connector wiring.  Of the numerous iPod car chargers out there only the <a href=\"http://monstercable.com/computer/productPageComputer.asp?pin=1880\">Monster iCharger</a> and as-yet-unreleased <a href=\"http://www.sik.com/imp.php\">SiK Imp</a> have true line outputs, but both place them awkwardly on the side of the dock connector plug; do you want yet another wire draping off the wire going into your iPod, only to have to run <em>that</em> that wire to your auxiliary input?  It makes for a messy dashboard/center console.  Belkin gets it half right in their <a href=\"http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Merchant_Id=&amp;Section_Id=201526&amp;pcount=&amp;Product_Id=149006\">Auto Kit for iPod</a>, providing an output on the cigarette lighter plug separate from the dock connector cord.  Unfortunately, this isn&#8217;t a true line-out, but rather an amplified signal with volume control independent from (and overriding) the iPod&#8217;s own.  Some users <a href=\"http://www.ipodlounge.com/forums/\">have reported</a> ground loop feedback and/or distorted sound from the Belkin unit&#8217;s amplifier, but others have had a rosy time of it.  I&#8217;m giving the Belkin a try out of sheer availability and preference for its placement of the &#8220;line&#8221; output.<br /><br /><br /><br />Completing my new iPod&#8217;s accessorizing (on a caliber that would make a Barbie jealous, I admit and lament) is a translucent arctic white <a href=\"http://www.iskin.com/exo2.html\">iSkin eXo2</a> for protection.  There a variety of these so-called &#8220;skin&#8221; cases but the iSkin is by far the best reviewed.  It&#8217;s lamentable that the iPod isn&#8217;t more durable, but then a more rugged design likely wouldn&#8217;t be nearly as appealing.  The iSkin retains as much of the iPod&#8217;s original aesthetic as possible while shielding it at least a bit from its surroundings.  After all that, the cased and connected iPod rides in the same <a href=\"http://www.radioshack.com/product.asp?cookie%5Ftest=1&amp;catalog%5Fname=CTLG&amp;category%5Fname=CTLG%5F001%5F004%5F008%5F002&amp;product%5Fid=17%2D548\">RadioShack AC Vent Wireless Phone Mount</a> I previously <a href=\"http://www.al3x.net/mt/archives/000145.html\">had good luck with</a>.  There are a handful of iPod-specific car mounts on the market, but why mess with a good and affordable thing?<br /><br /><br /><br />Apple certainly has a good racket going, both for themselves and accessory manufacturers.  Though I received this iPod as a gift, I&#8217;ve spent, well&#8230; I&#8217;ll let you add it up, but I&#8217;ve spent plenty to tailor the iPod to my lifestyle.  Or, more realistically, to tailor my lifestyle to the iPod.  It&#8217;s an utter illusion that the iPod is a product for hip people living hip lives; like all luxury goods (and it&#8217;s priced as such), the iPod is a lifestyle <em>defining</em> product, something to move you towards hipness.  In this respect it&#8217;s an ingenious design: you&#8217;re more likely to have a conversation about what you listen to your music <em>on</em> than the music itself, shifting cool from content to medium.  It&#8217;s nothing new, but brilliantly executed in the iPod.</p>"<br />
