<h1>Mac Filesharing Clients Update</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Awhile back I <a href=\"http://www.al3x.net/mt/archives/000246.html\">mentioned</a> Poisoned, a fine multi-network <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">P2P</span></span></span> client for Mac <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">OS X</span></span></span>.  Shortly thereafter I was directed to <a href=\"http://mlmac.sourceforge.net/\">mlMac</a>, which is similar in appearance and features, but while aiming to support more <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">P2P</span></span></span> networks and protocols instead falls short as a buggy and unstable mess that I&#8217;ve never once gotten a successful download out of.  In the vein of multi-network clients, stick to Poisoned; it&#8217;s only gotten better,<br /><br /><br /><br />But much of the Mac <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">P2P</span></span></span> world still rides on the Gnutellanet, one of the first open and decentralized (or at least more decentralized than not) post-Napster networks.  <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/acqlite/\">Acqlite</a>, a superb open source &#8220;fork&#8221; of the loathsome and spyware-ridden <a href=\"http://www.acquisitionx.com/\">Acquisition</a> (don&#8217;t let the site fool you: it&#8217;s <em>pure evil!</em>), is the best Gnutella client out there for <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">OS X</span></span></span>.  I have better luck getting just about anything with Acqlite than with Poisoned, for the record.<br /><br /><br /><br />There&#8217;s still no good Mac <a href=\"http://www.slsknet.org/\">Soulseek</a> client.  You can get the <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">GTK</span></span></span> client <a href=\"http://nicotine.thegraveyard.org/\">Nicotine</a> to run with some help from <a href=\"http://fink.sf.net/\">Fink</a> but the results aren&#8217;t worth the time; either Nicotine sucks or the Soulseek network is crap, and I think it&#8217;s a little of both.  Pity, because there&#8217;s no other <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">P2P</span></span></span> network I know of that caters community-wise to electronic and otherwise off-the-beaten-path music.<br /><br /><br /><br />Lastly there&#8217;s the swarming <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">P2P</span></span></span> <a href=\"http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/\">BitTorrent</a> software, of which there is a perfectly passable but not overwhelming <a href=\"http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/download.html\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">OS X</span></span></span> port</a>.  The BitTorrent scene is the place to be for filesharing these days, but rarely do I actually see the supposed speed benefits of swarming downloads.  For example (and purely for research purposes, Mr. Valenti) I&#8217;m pulling down a film from some reported 32 peers, yet my download speed varies between 7-11 kilobits per second.  That mediocre bandwidth means that it&#8217;ll take me, or rather my iBook, roughly an entire day to download the movie.  At the same time, however, I&#8217;ve already uploaded nearly three times as much as I&#8217;ve downloaded, megabyte-wise, of the portion of the file I&#8217;ve downloaded back to other Torrent users.  If somebody&#8217;s benefitting from all this sharing it sure isn&#8217;t me, but I can&#8217;t complain too much with the wide selection of files for the taking at sites like <a href=\"http://www.suprnova.org/\">Suprnova</a> and <a href=\"http://mac.torrentskickass.com/\">MacTorrents</a>.<br /><br /><br /><br />For the average user or <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">P2P</span></span></span> beginner Gnutella via Acqlite is probably the way to go on a Mac.  But for anything big or unusual forget the unreliability of the eDonkey and OpenFT implementations out there and go straight to BitTorrent.  Your sanity will thank you.</p>"<br />
