<h1>Sorted</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>I&#8217;ve resolved to go back to <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">UMBC</span></span></span> for another semester, and to schedule that semester to be nothing but engaging, enjoyable courses: none of this core curriculum bullshit I&#8217;ve been doing pretty much nonstop since I started college.  I got some great advice on my school/work/life dilemma but the most affecting was the suggestion to actually give myself a chance to be engaged by school before dismissing it.  So while I may have to contend with more dull requirements down the road, they&#8217;ll hardly seem so bad if I have a sense of a generally positive educational experience, or so the logic goes.  Alternately, if I go back this semester and still find myself unengaged then I know most certainly that full-time university is not for me.  It&#8217;s a safe bet, and I&#8217;ve taken enough stupid gambles in recent years to see the value there.<br /><br /><br /><br />Needless to say, the parental units are pleased with this decision.  And while I think I could have made the work + online education + tiny flat in the city thing work it would have been damn hard.  I guess I&#8217;ll know better in a semester if that difficulty was necessary for me or not.  Sometimes I feel like I have to learn everything the hardest way possible as some sort of karmic compensation for the opportunities and gifts of personal ability I&#8217;ve been given.  I&#8217;m hoping I&#8217;ll be able to take advantage of the education being offered to me despite that propensity to making things hard for myself.<br /><br /><br /><br />On the practical end of things I&#8217;ll be back in my apartment on campus, same room and same roommates.  I desperately, desperately need to be more social on campus, as driving down to DC every weekend to escape building a social life at <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">UMBC</span></span></span> just reinforces a lack of commitment to the school and my education there.<br/><br /><br /><br /><br />I believe, however, that my new espresso machine is key to expanding my social network.  There is no good coffee on the <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">UMBC</span></span></span> campus.  I think you see how my ploy works.  Social life?  Check.</p>"<br />
