<h1>Crisis Time</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>It&#8217;s that happy time of year again: marks from the Fall semester are in and, whaddyaknow?! they reflect my utter lack of interest in a full-time, on-campus college education.  Understandably, the familial powers that be are no longer interested in financing me to be utterly uninterested, so it&#8217;s Major Life Decision time right about now.<br /><br /><br /><br />Beg and plead (or alternately student loan) myself back into another semester at <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">UMBC</span></span></span>, where I could easily pick a handful of engaging courses guaranteed to end up as solid <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">GPA</span></span></span>-boosting grades for the coming Spring semester &#8211; and risk bombing again when the dull core classes have to inevitably be dealt with?<br /><br /><br /><br />Or get some serious, paying, mostly full-time work in the city, move to a lil&#8217; flat in the DC metro area, and finish up school online at <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">UMUC</span></span></span>?  Sure, it entails the same tedious core courses, but paying for the education on my dime and working at it on my time seem like pretty motivating factors to me.<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#8217;m leaning towards the latter, as I&#8217;ve had enough of years of scholastic ups-and-downs and feel like it&#8217;s time to take charge, get it over with on my terms, engage myself with work, and generally move on.  But that also means a harder life, financially and otherwise.<br /><br /><br /><br />Either way school&#8217;s gonna get done; I&#8217;ve accepted that a college degree is a must, and moreover a personal challenge I want to meet.  But how to do it, and where?<br /><br /><br /><br />Your suggestions are appreciated, dear readers.  I&#8217;ll be here, thinking it over.</p>"<br />
