<h1>Deep Thinking, Deep Bass</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Simon Reynolds <a href="http://blissout.blogspot.com/2004_01_04_blissout_archive.html#107353834054392035">riffs</a> on Tim Finney&#8217;s <a href="http://skykicking.tripod.com/2003_12_01_archive.html#107189075093233638">thoughts</a> on &#8220;rhythmic danger&#8221; in jungle/drum &#8216;n bass with such elegant language and historical accuracy that I wouldn&#8217;t dare offer my own addendum.  It&#8217;s reassuring that a) there are bigger genrewhores out there in electronic music fandom than me; b) there are people who love this music so much as to think such deep and multifaceted thoughts about it; c) the brief and intense history of this music is being documented in a personal fashion.  Essential reading.</p><br />
