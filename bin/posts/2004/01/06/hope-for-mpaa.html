<h1>Hope for the MPAA?</h1>
--- <br />- <p>There&#8217;s hope for this movie industry political behemoth if they heed Chris Anderson, editor of Wired magazine, and his <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.01/mpaa_pr.html">Memo to the New Head of the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">MPAA</span></span></span></a>.  The copyfight may be old news, but it&#8217;s not nearly over.  These suggestions could turn around the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">MPAA</span></span></span>&#8217;s public image &#8211; and their business.  Good stuff, and thankfully beholden to classic Wired values.</p><br />
