<h1>Not Really A Surprise</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I think it&#8217;s funny, but not particularly surprising, that <a href="http://412dnb.com/<sub>absolut/freqnasty/pages/1365%20Stuntrock%20and%20Doormouse.htm&#8221;&gt;these guys</a> are two of the hardest motherfuckers making breakcore/digital hardcore/really goddamn noisy beats today.  Seriously, every time I think I&#8217;m satisfied with listening to slick-ass tech/micro-house I put on some Stuntrock and remember what evil sounds like (a woman&#8217;s scream, endlessly looped, over positively decimated jungle beats).  And yes, evil sounds good.<br /><br /><br /><br />Punk is long since dead and these guys (along with their breakcore peers like Venetian Snares) are fucking its exhumed corpse.  And recording what that sounds like through a bunch of distortion for their next albums, probably.  They don&#8217;t need to be done up in $80 pre-ripped-and-safetypinned bondage pants and $25 reprints of Dead Kennedys t-shirts to be harder than your one creepy grabby uncle on Viagra.  <a href="http://home.golden.net/</sub>miq/mp3/D-TRASH29-STUNTROCK-ThePinnacleOfMediocrity/&#8221;&gt;Listen</a>.</p><br />
