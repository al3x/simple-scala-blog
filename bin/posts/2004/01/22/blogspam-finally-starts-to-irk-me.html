<h1>Blogspam Finally Starts To Irk Me</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Unlike a lot of bloggers I haven&#8217;t let blogspam get to me for a while.  The expressions of indignity (&#8220;they, why, they just can&#8217;t <em>do</em> this!  Blogspace is <em>our</em> space, pure and virginal!  This is so&#8230; so&#8230; <em><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">AOL</span></span></span></em>!&#8221;) amongst bloggers have been amusing to me.  I quietly installed <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/">MT-Blacklist</a> and filtered away at my blogspam, figuring such inconveniences were just part of the reality of having a presence in the wild ecosystem of cyberspace.<br /><br /><br /><br />But over and over the bots these blogspammers use have been hitting the same entry on this site, probably because it&#8217;s linked to from several fairly high-traffic blogs.  I&#8217;ve finally decided to close that entry for comments in an attempt to stem the now bi-daily tide of blogspam.  What sucks is that anyone who wants to make a legitimate comment on that entry is now unable to.  Blogspam has finally moved from mere nuisance to genuine roadblock for me and this blog.<br /><br /><br /><br />So fuck you, blogspammers.  Fuck you and everything you stand for.</p><br />
