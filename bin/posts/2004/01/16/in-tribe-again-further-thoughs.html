<h1>In The Tribe Again: Further Thoughs</h1>
--- <br />- |<br />  <p>I&#8217;m pleased with my decision to get back on Tribe.net from an information-gathering perspective: I&#8217;ve gotten lots of good Atkins advice, music reccomendations, and other generally provocative info.  The interface and performance of the site has improved dramatically since I was last on, and barring omissions like <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSS</span></span></span> feeds of discussions and expiring old/unused tribes (I&#8217;ve suggested both in the Tribe Ideas tribe to much agreement) the system works great.<br /><br /><br /><br />The people are still broken, though.  I have to forcibly stop myself from looking at most people&#8217;s profiles, searching for people, following links from one person to another, and so forth.  If I see another person with &#8220;sex&#8221; or &#8220;kissing&#8221; or &#8220;women/girls/men/boys&#8221; listed in their Interests I&#8217;m going to start breaking virtual heads.  The site still does nothing to keep people from being themselves (read: assholes), and I see that as a major flaw.  Sarcasm?  Uh, sure.<br /><br /><br /><br />The reality is that these sites are going to attract basically six kinds of people:</p><br /><br /><br />- |<br />  <ol><br />    <li> People who can&#8217;t meet people in meatspace because of serious issues.<br />    <li> People who don&#8217;t want to meet people in meatspace, just catalog virtual friends.<br />    <li> People who want to catalog their meatspace friends virtually to remind themselves how many friends they have.<br />    <li> People with alternative lifestyles and apparently no other hobbies or interests who want to catalog other people sharing their lifestyle.<br />    <li> People out for casual sex.<br />    <li> People out to be disruptive jerks in cyberspace because they&#8217;ll get the hell beaten out of them in meatspace, and rightly so.<br /></ol><br /><br /><br />- |<br />  <p>Sure, I&#8217;m hamming it up a bit, but online communities definitely attract some jerks, and some communities or types of communities more than others.  Social networking sites seem to be industrial strength asshat magnets.<br /><br /><br /><br />That makes it tough for the rest of us.  I feel like I&#8217;m being a good Tribe &#8220;citizen&#8221;: </p><br /><br /><br />- |<br />  <ul><br />    <li> I keep my profile informative and comma-delineated, as requested, for easy searching;<br />    <li> I only join tribes for actual things I&#8217;m actually into that I can actually contribute to;<br />    <li> I don&#8217;t start or join bullshit tribes (&#8220;<b><strong>!<img src="<strong>&#8221; alt=&#8221;&#8221; /&gt;</strong> super nuclear monkey knifefights lol</b><img src="</strong>&#8221; alt=&#8221;&#8221; /&gt;!&#8221;);<br />    <li> I&#8217;ve posted a genuine event in the apropos tribe and offered to meet random new Tribes&#8217;ers at said event;<br />    <li> My discussion posts are in the right thread or sub-thread&#8230;<br /></ul><br /><br /><br />- "<p>Alright, I&#8217;m reaching with that last one.  Still, one gets the sense looking around Tribe that it&#8217;s like Singapore taken over by anarchists (not cool Sex Pistols ones, either): a rule-bound domain that once worked exceedingly well due to its restrictive nature, now derelict with free-riders, idiots, and prostitutes.  I just want to use the system for what it&#8217;s intended: meeting new people, doing new things, finding out new information, and maybe selling a couch.<br /><br /><br /><br />Having long since given up on online dating sites, I&#8217;m hoping to use Tribe to make new just-friends and get out.  My one ray of hope to this end is the product of a search for my school, <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">UMBC</span></span></span>.  Amidst the usual slag of bullshit profiles and bullshit people (&#8220;Occupation: professional system fucker-upper&#8221;, &#8220;Here for: yr boyfriend!!! lol rofl!!&#8221;) I found one seemingly nice person and wrote him/her for advice on what to do in and around Baltimore, since I intend to spend less time fleeing to DC this coming semester.  This personal actually wrote me back with some suggestions and even a casual, passing invitation to hang out.  So for all my bitching, the system <em>can</em> work.<br /><br /><br /><br />Just rarely.</p>"<br />
