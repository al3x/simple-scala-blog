<h1>MWSF Reactions</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Everyone and her sister seems to think the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ipodmini/\">iPod mini</a> is overpriced at $250 for its target market of &#8220;high-end flash <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">MP3</span></span></span> players.&#8221;  I&#8217;m inclined to agree, but then I remember my initial reaction to the first iPod: absurdly high for something so base as an <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">MP3</span></span></span> player.  Well, the iPod turned out not only to sell in droves despite its price but evolve into more than an <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">MP3</span></span></span> player, both practically and aesthetically.  Apple will probably dominate the iPod mini&#8217;s target market with the same gusto and innate cool factor that has kept their brand afloat for years despite seemingly shaky business decisions.<br /><br /><br /><br />The rest of the announcements were nifty, but not earth-shattering.  Clearly, I want a new G5 <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/xserve/\">Xserve</a> and I think you all should start robbing the poor, sick, weak, and aged to help me pay for it.<br/><br /><br /><br /><br />Then, I&#8217;ll write a song to reward you with <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/\">GarageBand</a>, which in all seriousness I see as being the fucking <em>joint</em>.  I worry that it&#8217;s family-targeted image will prevent &#8220;serious&#8221; musicians from adopting it.  GarageBand has a feature set that handily outstrips pretty much everything short of the big-money professional <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">DAW</span></span></span> packages like Logic and Pro Tools.  Its loop-stretching, as I mention in my keynote minutes below, matches <a href=\"http://mediasoftware.sonypictures.com/Products/ShowProduct.asp?PID=854\">Acid</a>&#8217;s without breaking a sweat, its virtual instruments look better than 90% of the sampled or synthesized solutions out there in the pro audio world, and its amp simulations sound robust and warm (I can&#8217;t wait to try running my vocals through them!).  All that for the $45-or-free cost of the iLife suite makes it attractive enough that I&#8217;ll likely use it for a couple songs that&#8217;ve been floating around my head, and I&#8217;ll bet I&#8217;m not alone amongst semi-pro &#8220;audio enthusiasts.&#8221;  Cakewalk and everything else in the sub-$500 home studio price range can take a hike; I see only more specialized apps like <a href=\"http://www.ableton.com/\">Ableton Live</a> surviving GarageBand&#8217;s awesome awesomeness if it performs half as well as it demos.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Office 2004 and <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ilife/\">iLife</a> updates are pleasant, but the sort of they-should-have-done-all-that-last-version updates that it&#8217;s hard to get excited about.  And lastly, tiny announcement though it may be, I&#8217;m interested in hearing a pair of Apple&#8217;s new <a href=\"http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore?productLearnMore=M9394G/A\">in-ear headphones</a>, which hopefully sound as good as they look.  All told, a good, hopefully undetrimental, but not earth-shattering round of announcements from Steve and the gang.</p>"<br />
