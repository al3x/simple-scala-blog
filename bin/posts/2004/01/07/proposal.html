<h1>Proposal</h1>
--- <br />- "<p><a href=\"http://www.justagwailo.com/\">Richard Gwai Lo</a> <a href=\"http://www.justagwailo.com/filter/2004/01/06/naked-condo\">writes today</a> that he just read the entire archives of &#8220;a weblog about not getting laid in a culture saturated with sex,&#8221; a fair example of his views and situation vis-a-vis modern relationships. <a href=\"http://www.makeoutcity.com/\">Jay Makeoutcity</a>, in contrast, has <a href=\"http://www.makeoutcity.com/Categories/Writing/MyLifeOfLove/\">written about deep love</a> for a young woman he is (I presume) presently in a relationship with.  And <a href=\"http://accordionguy.blogware.com/blog\">Joey Accordion Guy</a> is <a href=\"http://accordionguy.blogware.com/blog/<em>archives/2003/12/29/11129.html&#8221;&gt;happily courting another blogger</a>, and has written about dating with the experience of many years.  I&#8217;ve written about relationships here but decided to abstain for awhile.  From writing, that is.  Eh-heh.<br /><br /><br /><br />So here&#8217;s what I see: we&#8217;ve got the can&#8217;t-get-a-date guy, the oh-so-in-love guy, the master-of-dating guy, and the, uh, um.. should-probably-be-dating-more-than-he-is guy (?, me).  I think the four of us need to get together for some sort of twisted bloggery geeky guy&#8217;s night out and officially hammer out the new rules for non-married men, or at least non-married blogging men.  And blog our discussion, of course.<br /><br /><br /><br />Alright, so it&#8217;s nothing that couldn&#8217;t transpire online.  But it&#8217;s a pretty good excuse for taking three of my favorite bloggers out to dinner, don&#8217;tcha think?  Now, assuming they&#8217;d be down, if we can just get past this damn geolocation hitch&#8230;  <sup></em></sup></p>"<br />
