<h1>Dedicated Hosting Reccomendations?</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>The project I&#8217;m working on at my new gig requires a dedicated server.  I&#8217;ve worked with a few dedicated hosting shops, but it&#8217;s a huge market.  We need a solid x86 box running either a Linux variant (RedHat and Gentoo preferred) or FreeBSD, sitting on a seriously fat pipe, and none of this &#8220;administrative privileges but no root&#8221; bullshit: I need to get crazy freaky with some Apache configs.  No colo providers, just dedicated hosting.<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.serverbeach.com/\">ServerBeach</a> looks good and affordable, but I&#8217;d like some first-hand recommendations if you&#8217;d like to share/rave/vent.  Much appreciated!</p>"<br />
