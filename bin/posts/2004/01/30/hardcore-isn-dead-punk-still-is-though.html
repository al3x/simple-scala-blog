<h1>Hardcore Isn&#8217;t Dead (Punk Still Is, Though)</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>I&#8217;m talking hardcore techno.  &#8216;Ardkore.  The sound of the mid-&#8217;90s electronic music scene, when ecstasy dreams gave way to amphetamine aggression and k-hole catastrophes.  Hardcore birthed our beloved Jungle, and remains the bedrock upon which new amped-up electronic sounds are built.  Hardcore was essential, but is now for most DJs and music fans a sound long since gone the way of nostalgia.<br /><br /><br /><br />Hardcore isn&#8217;t dead for DJ Scud and Panacea, both respected purveyors of exactly the sort of music that evolved from hardcore: dark Jungle, gabber, breakcore, and so forth.  As The Redeemer they&#8217;ve crafted the perfect hardcore homage album in <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/release/130596\"><em>Hardcore Owes Us Money</em></a>, a loving tribute to the bygone sound despite its cocky name.  Every cliche in the hardcore book is revisited, but with the clean room sterility of latter-day Jungle production and the influence of more recent musical and technological developments.  A close listen to superb tracks like &#8220;Sound Killah&#8221; will reveal sampledelic nods like the &#8220;Hallelujah!&#8221; diva wail from the classic Happy Mondays rave anthem of the same name.  Yet for all the retro references, tracks like &#8220;Pitbull&#8221; could seamlessly lie their rolling, growling bass in a mix with today&#8217;s jungle tracks.<br /><br /><br /><br />Does that mean we haven&#8217;t come far from the &#8216;ardkore days?  Not necessarily.  It just means that some good things never change.</p>"<br />
