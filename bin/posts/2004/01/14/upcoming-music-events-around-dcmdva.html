I&#8217;m pretty <a href="http://www.5dots.net/">CraigDots</a> will be unleashing a hellish storm of noise from his iBook, as has become customary.  I, on the other hand, will not be performing this time around.  But OpenMinijax is a great event, a sort of &#8220;open amp night&#8221; for electronic musicians using kit that hooks up to nothing more complicated than a headphone jack.  Sure, it&#8217;s mostly laptop musicians, but we also get some GameBoy rockers and circuitbender jammers.<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#8217;ll happily drive interested readers in the DC/MD/VA area to either event, or meet up there if you&#8217;ve got your own transportation.  Is it a little odd to just offer to hang out with a blogger (or reader) you&#8217;ve never met?  A little less so than somebody whose thoughts and perspectives you have no idea about, I guess.  I&#8217;m just trying to meet new people, so let me know if you&#8217;re interested in these shows.</p><br />
