<h1>Open Source in Government, Open Source for Better Government</h1>
--- <br />- <p>A couple items caught my eyes in the ol&#8217; tech/government vein.<br /><br /><br /><br />The first, via <a href="http://www.diepunyhumans.com/">Warren Ellis</a>, is a <a href="http://partnerships.typepad.com/civic/2004/01/top_10_open_sou.html">list</a> of the top ten open source tools for electronic activism.  There are some powerful tools there, whether you&#8217;re trying to just get your niche issue across or, say, run an entire campaign.<br /><br /><br /><br />The second is a Linux Journal <a href="http://linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=7131">report</a> on the increasing presence of the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">LAMP</span></span></span> (Linux + Apache + MySQL + <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">PHP</span></span></span>/Perl/Python) platform powering government websites and online resources.  It&#8217;s mostly the doing of shops that G-men contract out to, but it&#8217;s still a Good Thing.<br /><br /><br /><br />I don&#8217;t want to count my chickens before they hatch, but I may be having a fair bit to do with these sorts of things shortly, if all goes well.  Exciting stuff.</p><br />
