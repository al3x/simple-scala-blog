<h1>Another CSA</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Several of the InfoSec guys (read: 31337 hax0rz) I was hanging out with on Friday run nifty Cool Shit Aggregator (<a href=\"http://www.al3x.net/mt/archives/000255.html\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">CSA</span></span></span></a>) called <a href=\"http://www.pantsfactory.org/\">Pants Factory</a>.  It&#8217;s got a definite security bent to it, but there&#8217;s some cool and funny stuff there too.  Look, but don&#8217;t touch: this is mostly by the authors and for the authors, and having run a little community site like that I can safely say that they <em>don&#8217;t</em> want your three week stale <a href=\"http://www.fark.com/\">Fark</a> links.  Jerkass.</p>"<br />
