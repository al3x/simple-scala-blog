<h1>Senses</h1>
--- <br />- "<ol><br />    <li> The cartoon character pitched-up sound of a diva wailing &#8220;you abandoned me&#8221; in a mix of old &#8216;ardkore techno pumping out my iPod -&gt; car stereo.<br />    <li> The familiar sights of the drive to Pentagon City Mall, the mall itself, and old 2600 friends and acquaintances.<br />    <li> The taste of cheerily advertised low-carb chicken processed fake sauce strips at a chain restaurant.<br />    <li> The smell of Middle Eastern cafe Oasis: falafel buried under cigarettes and hookah smoke.<br />    <li> The airy, just-thick-enough-like-good-custard taste and smell of banana shisha, and the disappointingly saccharine taste of coconut shisha.<br />    <li> The sight of a cheap remake of a classic wooden table filled with the multicolored, tri-sized plastic pyramids that form the structures of a Zendo game.<br />    <li> The sound of good conversation, and ridiculous conversation, and sometimes both.<br />    <li> The feeling of cold real air and hot fake air colliding.<br /></ol>"<br />
