<h1>In The Tribe Again</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I&#8217;m back on <a href="http://www.tribe.net/">Tribe.net</a>.  I missed the Family Guy tribe discussions and a couple of the others.  If you were in my circle of friends on Tribe please don&#8217;t hesitate to add yourself again.<br/><br /><br /><br /><br />Hypocritical for criticizing Tribe, leaving, and then coming back?  I guess.  Its interface has improved a touch, at least.  Whatever.  It&#8217;s still better than Friendster.</p><br />
