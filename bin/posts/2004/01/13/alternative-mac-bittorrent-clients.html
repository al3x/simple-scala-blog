<h1>Alternative Mac BitTorrent Clients</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Sarwat Khan has <a href="http://sarwat.net/bittorrent/">whipped up</a> a more full-featured expansion of the BitTorrent 3.3 code for Mac <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span></span>, keeping the same name but piling on the features.  The application feels like it could use some touch-ups for Panther, however.<br /><br /><br /><br />Recommended to me was <a href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/">Azureus</a>, a Java BitTorrent client with even more bells and whistles but, in my view, a long way to go on the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">GUI</span></span></span> and stability.  Still, it&#8217;s better than the generic <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span></span> client.<br /><br /><br /><br />Options, options.</p><br />
