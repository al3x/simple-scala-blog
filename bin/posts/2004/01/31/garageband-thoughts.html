<h1>GarageBand Thoughts</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>I finally got a chance to play with GarageBand, both on a reasonably powerful G4 laptop and my year-old iBook G3.  All complaints of poor performance on anything less than a blazing new G5 are well founded, it seems.<br /><br /><br /><br />It&#8217;s late, so I&#8217;ll be terse.  GarageBand is, barring its resource requirements, perfect for doing what it intends to do: bringing easy digital music making to Apple&#8217;s target &#8220;home creative&#8221; user base.  It&#8217;s friendly, it&#8217;s simple, it&#8217;s got a polished sample library, et cetera et cetera.<br /><br /><br /><br />I thought, as a semi-semi-semi-pro musician, that I might enjoy some of its features and use it for occasional recording flourishes.  But between 13 second lags when dragging a sample to the song layout and a general feeling of &#8220;preset lock&#8221; I can&#8217;t ever see using it.  It just feels like everything that comes out of the app will sound inextricably like it, much like one can spot a Photoshop filter from miles away.  A creative user can overcome this, of course, and I&#8217;m sure people will make great stuff with GarageBand.  But for the kind of music I make it just doesn&#8217;t jive as an inspirational tool.  So off my hard drive it goes, and its 2GB library of proprietary format samples with it.<br /><br /><br /><br />If I was a more traditional musician it&#8217;d be the business, though.  Different strokes.  That&#8217;s all.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">UPDATE</span></span></span>:</strong> Booga wanted to know if I still felt that GarageBand is competitive with other loop-stretching programs like Acid.  The answer is &#8220;yes.&#8221;  GB can do what Acid does, and a drum loop intended for 110BPM still sounds good at 160BPM (the first thing I tried).  The app is definitely an Acid-killer, but can&#8217;t lay a finger on loop-based tools like Live.</p>"<br />
