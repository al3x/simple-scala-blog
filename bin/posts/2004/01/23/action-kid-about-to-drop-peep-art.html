<h1>&#8220;Disaster Action Kid&#8221; About to Drop &#8211; Peep the Art</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>You should <a href=\"http://www.5dots.net/news/archives/000023.html\">look</a> at the album art for <a href=\"http://www.adjectiverecords.com/\">Adjective Records</a>&#8217; first release, &#8220;Disaster Action Kid&#8221; by <a href=\"http://www.5dots.net/\">5dots</a> because its really really good.  I founded and &#8220;run&#8221; Adjective (in the loosest sense of the term) with Craig/5dots and <a href=\"http://www.acesulfamek.com/\">Brittany</a>, and we couldn&#8217;t more excited about this first release.  Well, Brittany is pretty excited about knitting, probably more so than the release, but Craig and I are excited.  In fact, things on the whole for Adjective are going great: the album has come together in sound, style and quality; the label is getting material from prospective artists almost weekly; and 5dots has really come into his own as a performer, as evidenced by his set at this past Sunday&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.techclub-dc.com/\">OpenMinijax</a>.<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#8217;m in the album credits for &#8220;telling [5dots] what sucks,&#8221; and I&#8217;ll admit that I imparted my share of criticism when Craig was first exploring the sound of this release.  But for my criticism, or perhaps in spite of it, he&#8217;s really found a groove &#8211; a gritty, distorted, jiggy, playful, and genuinely engaging groove.  So my criticism comes to an end, as I&#8217;m really happy to have my name associated with this release.  This thing is gonna drop like a firebomb.  Fo&#8217; real.<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#8217;ll save my negative comments for the demos we&#8217;ve been getting.  Goddamn but there&#8217;s some shitty music out there.  Goddamn.</p>"<br />
