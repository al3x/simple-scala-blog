<h1>Tonight&#8217;s Show: Al3x Hearts Traktor</h1>
<p>I\&#8217;m having so much fun mixing in Traktor since it arrived last week that I decided to eschew all genre focus and just play a really enjoyable set that takes advantage of the software\&#8217;s ability to facilitate elegant mixes across styles and <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BPM</span></span> gaps.  Tonight\&#8217;s mix jumps around from breaks to minimal techno to garage to house to downtempo to electronica; there\&#8217;s something for everyone to enjoy.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>8 &#8211; 9 <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PM EST</span></span> on <a href="http://wmbc.umbc.edu/"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">WMBC</span></span></a>.</strong></p>
