<h1>Pseudonym Nitpicking</h1>
<p>I can\&#8217;t complain too much.  Plenty of people out there refer to me by my handle, indulging me in the &#8220;3&#8221; that graces this <span class="caps"><span class="caps">URL</span></span>, my email address, and my accounts in various forums and communities around the Net.  I rarely get too much flack about it, either.  I\&#8217;d like to think I\&#8217;ve earned my &#8220;3&#8221;, having adopted it well before the days of commoners speaking <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A787917">l33t</a> and backed it up with geek cred.  I\&#8217;ve been strongly considering making the &#8220;3&#8221; my next tattoo.  I digress.</p><br /><br /><p>I\&#8217;m not so attached to my handle that I expect to always be referred to by it; I don\&#8217;t mind &#8220;Alex&#8221; or &#8220;Alexander&#8221;.  But I would ask that if referring to me by my handle you not capitalize the &#8220;a&#8221;: that is, please refer to me as &#8220;al3x&#8221;, not &#8220;Al3x&#8221;.  The latter looks typographically awkward.</p><br /><br /><p>This has been a public service announcement.  You may now return to your regularly scheduled weblog. </p>
