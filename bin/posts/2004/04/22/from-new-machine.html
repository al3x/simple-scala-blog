<h1>From The New Machine</h1>
<p>I\&#8217;m writing this from my new machine, which I purchased from an Apple retail store because of oddness about not being able to split payment between two methods via their online and phone sales.  Because the retail stores don\&#8217;t have custom configurations I ended up with a SuperDrive I likely won\&#8217;t use (but don\&#8217;t really mind) and a standard 4200 <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RPM</span></span> hard drive rather than a 5400.  The machine is superb: one ignorable dead pixel on a screen as bright and large as a thousand suns.  And I keep turning out the lights to see the keyboard backlighting.</p><br /><br /><p>My old iBook is going to a friend-of-a-friend for a fair price given its suffering under my ownership, where I am sure it will have a good home.  I might ping it every now and again, just to be sure it\&#8217;s okay.</p>
