<h1>Where The Desktops At?</h1>
<p>So, it\&#8217;s a terribly <em>net</em> question to ask, but where did you find your desktop picture/background?  Bully for you camera buffs with nice photos to use, but what about the rest of us?  I\&#8217;ve looked in all the obvious and Google-proffered places for nice widescreen desktops for the new machine (named &#8220;Akarui&#8221; this evening, meaning &#8220;bright&#8221;) to no avail.  Links appreciated.</p>
