<h1>Oh Yeah, The Upgrades</h1>
<p>Not really much new to say about yesterday\&#8217;s iBook and PowerBook G4 <a href="http://www.macnn.com/news/24282">speed bumps</a>.  It\&#8217;s nice that 802.11g is now standard on the PowerBooks.  But really, like every other Mac-maniac out there (particularly those of us with ailing machines), I was hoping for a PowerBook G5.  Greg Joswiak, Apple vice-president of hardware product marketing, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3639825.stm">suggests to the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BBC</span></span></a> that &#8220;it will be some time before [the G5] will be in a notebook.&#8221;</p><br /><br /><p>Crap.  I mean, I understand why it\&#8217;s taking so long to deliver, from a technical perspective.  But I just know my iBook will die right before the PowerBook G5 hits the streets.  I\&#8217;ll inevitably end up shelling out for one of these updated PowerBook <span class="caps"><span class="caps">G4 15</span></span>&#8221;s that will be utterly primitive once the G5 is out.  That\&#8217;s just the way it goes.</p><br /><br /><p>Of course, I could break my Apple allegiance and get a <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/04/20/ibm_colour_thinkpads/">pastel ThinkPad</a>.  Or, y\&#8217;know, not.</p>
