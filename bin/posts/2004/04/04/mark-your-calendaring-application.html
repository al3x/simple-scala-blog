<p>The time is finally nigh.  <a href="http://www.5dots.net/">5dots</a> releases <em>Disaster Action Kid</em>, his first full-length CD, on our <a href="http://www.adjectiverecords.com">Adjective Records</a> label April 27th.  He\&#8217;s announced as much <a href="http://www.5dots.net/news/archives/000035.html">here</a>.</p><br /><br /><p>To celebrate, we\&#8217;re having a release party, announced <a href="http://www.adjectiverecords.com/index.php?p=8">here</a>.  The nitty gritty:</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Saturday, April 30th at <a href="http://www.warehousetheater.com">The Warehouse Next Door</a><br />1017 7th Street NW, Washington DC<br />Doors at 9, $8<br />All ages<br /></strong></p><br /><br /><p>We\&#8217;ve got several great acts before the big 5 does his thing.  I\&#8217;ll be spinning between the other band\&#8217;s sets all night and then softening up the place for 5dots with a crazed genre-demolishing mix of my own.</p><br /><br /><p>Attendance is clearly mandatory.</p>
