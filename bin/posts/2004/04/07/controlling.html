<h1>Controlling</h1>
<p>My set tonight went really well, but working around the <a href="http://www.evolution.co.uk/products/evo_xsession.htm">Evolution X-Session UC-17</a> is not exactly intuitive.  It in no way mirrors the layout of Traktor, which in turn attempts to mimic a traditional DJ setup.  This slows down mixing, as my hands have to translate from the deck-mixer-deck screen layout to the long-stupid-rows-of-knobs of the X-Session.  Fortunately it\&#8217;s not too much of a setback, as years of video games have got my brain quite comfortable with disassociating tactile controls from their visual results (&#8220;hit top button, guy on screen shoots gun&#8230; yes, of course!&#8221;).</p><br /><br /><p>But <a href="http://faderfox.de/Faderfox-Homepage_english/DJ1_english/body_dj1_english.html">this controller</a>, on the other hand, is designed from the ground up for Traktor, and I lust after it.  Unfortunately its German designer apparently needs a US business license to ship direct to the States, thus complicating its acquisition.  Still, this is the controller that Native Instruments or some other industry manufacturer should be looking to license.</p>
