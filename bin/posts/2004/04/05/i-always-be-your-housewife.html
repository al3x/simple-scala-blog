<p><a href="http://www.konzert-buero.de/bands/cocorosie/">CocoRosie</a> could be really poorly described as &#8220;Portishead but way strange,&#8221; but that doesn\&#8217;t really bring across much more than the vague similarity in vocal stylings.  If you like music by weird girls (Bjork, Tori Amos, etc. etc.) you\&#8217;ll like this just as much.</p>
