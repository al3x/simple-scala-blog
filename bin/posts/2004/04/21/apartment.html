<h1>The Apartment</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.superfuturecity.com/">Phil</a> and I got the apartment we wanted.  We\&#8217;ll be living <a href="http://www.madisonvictorian.com/">here</a>; our floorplan is <a href="http://www.madisonvictorian.com/unit_d.html">this one</a>.  The rental prices listed on that site aren\&#8217;t accurate, as the competitive and struggling DC real estate market rendered this unfathomably beautiful place comfortably in our price range with amenities you wouldn\&#8217;t believe.  We\&#8217;re stunned and excited.</p><br /><br /><p>I move in mid-May, and Phil follows in June when the lease is up on his current pad.  Expect a housewarming shindig suitable of this seriously swank domicile.</p>
