<h1>Selection 3: Downtempo</h1>
<p>Not at a lot to say about tonight\&#8217;s mix, other than that it\&#8217;s sweet and beautiful and you\&#8217;ll love it.  Tracks jump around in country of origin, sound, and release year, but never anything less than a relaxing groove.  Gonna try to remember to record it this time, too, for those of you who can\&#8217;t <strong>tune in tonight 8PM <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EST</span></span> on <a href="http://wmbc.umbc.edu"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">WMBC</span></span></a></strong>.</p>
