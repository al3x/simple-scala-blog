<h1>OSS Murmurings</h1>
<p>NewsForge has a nice <a href="http://business.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/04/09/1854218&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=85&amp;pagenum=1">article</a> on Open Source Software helping out nonprofits.  It mentions the <a href="http://www.nosi.net/">Nonprofit Open Source Initiative</a> (NOSI), of which my company, <a href="http://www.picnet.net/">PICnet, Inc.</a>, is a member and supporter.  Nonprofits have many unique organizational problems to solve, and unlike their for-profit peers, generally have to solve them in public.  Open code makes perfect sense for solving open problems.</p><br /><br /><p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.ebcvg.com/press.php?id=260">registration has opened</a> for the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2004/">O\&#8217;Reilly Open Source Convention 2004</a>.  I hope to be there, as a number of the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/29/oscon_track_grid.html">tracks</a> look pretty informative.</p>
