<h1>Selection 3: Tech-House Redux</h1>
<p>Tonight\&#8217;s show will revisit the dubby tech-house selection I had pieced together in Ableton Live some months back, this time shooting for a smoother mix in Traktor.  Some of the tracks will be familiar if tuned in the first time around, and I\&#8217;m throwing in some funky new musical acquisitions to spice it up.  Of course, if you didn\&#8217;t tune in the first time it\&#8217;ll all be new to you!  </p><br /><br /><p>As is becoming customary, an <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MP3</span></span> will be be made available, but that\&#8217;s no reason not to listen in live at <strong>8PM <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EST</span></span> on <a href="http://wmbc.umbc.edu/"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">WMBC</span></span></a>!</strong></p>
