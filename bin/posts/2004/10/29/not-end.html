<h1>Not The End</h1>
<p>Hello again.</p><br /><br /><p>I was getting the blogging itch again (I hear Pfizer is working on an ointment), but figured my archives lost to the ages.  As it turns out the contents of my blog laid intact in a previous hosts&#8217; MySQL database, ripe for the exporting.  A few <code>scp</code>&#8217;s later and here we are like I never abandoned the bloody thing, and leaving you wondering just how I reconcile reinstating this blog with the denouncements in my outgoing post way back in June.  It&#8217;s like this:</p><br /><br /><p>I still can&#8217;t talk about work.  I still don&#8217;t feel qualified talking about politics and world events, nor entirely confident posting personal thoughts, but I&#8217;ll do both anyway.  I&#8217;m still unconvinced of any universal worth in blogging but I don&#8217;t much care about all that as long as I&#8217;m having fun writing &#8211; which I wasn&#8217;t when last I left you, but I think I can now.  I still intend to keep nifty links and web-memery to <a href="http://del.icio.us/al3x">del.icio.us</a>, and I&#8217;ll provide a view of those here.</p><br /><br /><p>Archived posts are at the same location they used to be, so Googlers can once again revel in my years of dedicated bullshitting.  Comments have been disabled for all old posts, mostly for anti-spam purposes but also as some minor attempt to start anew.  Posts on music will be made at a group music blog I&#8217;m starting with several friends, which I will of course announce here when it&#8217;s live (soon, guys, sorry). </p><br /><br /><p>And that&#8217;s it.  Away we go.</p>
