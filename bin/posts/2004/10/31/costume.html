<h1>Costume</h1>
<p>My Halloween costume this year was <a href="http://www.bush-zombiereagan.com/">zombie Reagan</a>, perhaps better described: Frankenreagan, given that I applied faux bolts to my neck.  I wore a standard Reagan mask, the aforementioned bolts masked with a touch of greenish makeup on my neck, a black suit with a white dress shirt, and a red-with-blue-stripes-and-ducks old man tie from a thrift store down the street, and an authentic vintage &#8220;Your Next President: Ronald Reagan&#8221; pin from a political memorabilia shop in downtown DC.  Political costumes are never the hit of the party, but people were amused once they had taken in the details.</p><br /><br /><p>Pictures exist, but I will not go out of my way to procure even digital copies.  I didn&#8217;t wear the mask hardly at all, so there&#8217;s not much to see.  Enjoy the festivities this weekend; it&#8217;s a good Halloween weekend that lets you carouse under a blood moon.</p>
