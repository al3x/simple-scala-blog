<h1>The DC Perspective on Reagan</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A23386-2004Jun7.html?nav=rss_metro">This piece</a> in today&#8217;s Washington Post is one of the only pieces from the multitudes pouring out about the deceased former President that I&#8217;ve liked.  It is not positive and admiring, nor is it vengeful, petty, or disrespectful.  The piece tells it like it is, with a justified air of sadness for the lives affected by Reagan and his administration.</p><br /><br /><p>I despise partisan politics even more than the policies of the Reagan era and their lasting effects, which I disagree with from an independent perspective.  Watching liberals and conservatives duke it out over the man&#8217;s corpse has been disgusting.  Every liberal who thinks he&#8217;s doing the world a favor by holding his tongue on the negative aspects of the Reagan years while memorials drag on this week is a disingenuous coward; every conservative manipulating this chance for respectful reminiscing and historical perspective to further her platform is an opportunistic graverobber.</p>
