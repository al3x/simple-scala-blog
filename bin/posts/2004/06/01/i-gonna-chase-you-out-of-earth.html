<h1>I&#8217;m Gonna Chase You Out of Earth</h1>
<p>&#8220;99 Problems&#8221; may be Jay-Z&#8217;s big single right now, but the Kayne West-produced &#8220;Lucifer&#8221; is my present favorite on <em>The Black Album</em>.  The dub/reggae flavor of the track, its brevity and purposeful production, and the juxtaposition of the easy-riding groove with the tense guitar strumming and the pressure of the refrain (&#8220;I&#8217;m from the murder capital / where we murder for capital&#8221;) all make it a sleeper standout.  I doubt it&#8217;ll make its way to the radio after &#8220;99 Problems,&#8221; but it deserves its place in any solid summery dubby DJ set &#8211; or your iPod.</p>
