<p>OpenBSD <a href="http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&amp;sid=20040607133603">excising future Apache httpd developments</a> seems, unfortunately, like yet another reason not to run the heavily audited OS as anything more than a firewall/router box.  I see where they&#8217;re coming from, and there&#8217;s always custom compiles, but it seems like they&#8217;re auditing themselves into a corner.</p>
