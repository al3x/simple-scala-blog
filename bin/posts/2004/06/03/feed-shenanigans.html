<h1>Feed Shenanigans</h1>
<p>If you were seeing formatting characters in my <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSS</span></span> feed before, you shouldn&#8217;t be now (unsubscribe and re-subscribe in NetNewsWire, <a href="http://www.holeinthebox.com/">Scott</a> <sup>_</sup>).  The error stemmed from an unformatted ampersand slipping by WordPress&#8217;s filters, thus invalidating my feed and causing it to misrender.  Woo.  Bugs.</p>
