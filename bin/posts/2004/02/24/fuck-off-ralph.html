<h1>Fuck Off, Ralph</h1>
<p>As a registered independent not willing to relinquish that status for a vote in the Maryland primary, you\&#8217;d think I\&#8217;d be pro-Nader just on the merit of having an independent in the race.  Nope.  Nuh-uh.  </p><br /><br /><p>Most commentaries are saying, &#8220;there\&#8217;s a time for ideology, and there\&#8217;s a time for political reality.&#8221;  I think those two are one in the same in this case.  If Nader gave a shit about anybody but himself he wouldn\&#8217;t have so much as donned a unbleached cotton sweatband for this race.  &#8220;Anybody But Bush&#8221; isn\&#8217;t just a slogan; for the next nine months, it\&#8217;s a goddamn <em>mantra</em>.  </p><br /><br /><p>And you\&#8217;d think those hippy-ass Greens would be down with mantras.</p>
