<h1>Selection 3: No, Wait, Selection 5!</h1>
<p>Tomorrow night\&#8217;s Selection 3 will be selected and hosted by none other than 5dots, who has a playlist I\&#8217;ve not yet seen at <a href="http://www.5dots.net/news/archives/000030.html">his site</a>.</p><br /><br /><p>This is interesting for a couple reasons.  First, I have no idea what he\&#8217;s playing, just a CD of tracks I\&#8217;m told is an hour long and appropriate for radio.  I\&#8217;ve also been told it\&#8217;s not &#8220;The Gambler&#8221; seven or eight times over, but I could have been lied to.  The second reason you should tune in is that 5dots won\&#8217;t actually be in the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">WMBC</span></span> studios.  He\&#8217;s hosting the entire thing from Virginia, literally &#8220;phoning it in,&#8221; probably via iChat.</p><br /><br /><p>So if you\&#8217;re sick of my shit, tune in tomorrow from 8-9PM on <a href="http://wmbc.umbc.edu"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">WMBC</span></span></a>.</p>
