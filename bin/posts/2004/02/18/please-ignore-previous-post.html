<h1>Please Ignore The Previous Post</h1>
<p>...well, if you don\&#8217;t already know or care about my basic personal details.  But that <a href="http://www.al3x.net/archives/2004/02/17/about-al3x/">previous post</a> will henceforth serve as my &#8220;about\&#8217; page, and will be updated as necessary.  If there\&#8217;s anything you\&#8217;d like to know about me that you think should be on there, don\&#8217;t hesitate to let me know.  Most of that, and more, is available to anyone on Orkut, so I figured I might as well put it up here.  I don\&#8217;t like little lists of personal keywords, but I <em>really</em> don\&#8217;t like cutesy, self-effacing, oh-so-clever mini-autobiographies.  So that\&#8217;s what random visitors get to read about me.</p><br /><br /><p>In other site news, I\&#8217;ve been fiddling with little details here and there, but the new design and backend is pretty much all settled in.  I\&#8217;ve also implemented <a href="textism.com/tools/refer/">Refer</a>, having been inspired by <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2004/02/17/referral_rant.html">this smart post</a> by Rands on information as the currency and lifeblood of weblogging.</p>
