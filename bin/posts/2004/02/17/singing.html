<h1>Singing</h1>
<p>It\&#8217;s not like if I had decided to make those songs I would have been singing them for a crowd regularly, but it makes me consider how I\&#8217;m going to get my singing fix.  I love to sing, mostly along with whatever I\&#8217;m listening to.  I\&#8217;m not even sure the songs I wrote were all that much fun for me to sing.</p><br /><br /><p>I never felt, when in relationships, the need to sing for an anybody but the girl I was with.  It\&#8217;s the perfect metaphor for the way I feel most days: not so much missing being in love with a particular person as just being in love at all, with all its wonderful trappings.  </p><br /><br /><p>It would be nice to have somebody to sing for again.  Until then I\&#8217;m happy making odd harmonies with <a href="http://www.arts-crafts.ca/bss/">Broken Social Scene</a>\&#8217;s <a href="http://www.geocities.com/glimpseintothefuture/Broken_Social_Scene_-_anthems.mp3">&#8220;Anthems For a Seventeen Year-Old Girl.&#8221;</a></p>
