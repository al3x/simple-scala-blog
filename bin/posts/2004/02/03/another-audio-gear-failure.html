<h1>Another Audio Gear Failure</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ve been over this bullshit before.  Computer musicians want a portable <span class="caps"><span class="caps">USB</span></span> or FireWire <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MIDI</span></span> unit that provides a keyboard, some assignable controllers, and a multichannel audio interface.  Most computer musicians need multiple outputs, and they need a dedicated headphone output for pre-listening, a feature essential to digital DJ applications and live performance software like Ableton Live.<br /><br /><br /><br />Nobody has yet built a device that does this, despite the components being readily available and no engineering barriers hindering such a product&#8217;s development.  M-Audio came close with their Ozone, and it seemed on spec like Edirol got it right with their <a href="edirol.com/products/info/pcr1.html"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">PCR</span></span>-1</a>.<br /><br /><br /><br />But Edirol fucked it up.  I just got this email from their sales department:</p><br /><br /><blockquote><br /><tt><br />Hi there,<br /><br />The headphone output mirrors the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RCA</span></span> output on the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PCR</span></span>-1.<br /><br /><br /><br />Kindly,<br /><br />Chris Douglass<br /><br /><span class="caps"><span class="caps">LEAD PRODUCT SPECIALIST</span></span><br /><br />360.594.4273X213 phone<br /><br />360.594.4271 fax<br /></tt><br /></blockquote><br /><br /><p>That means that the headphone output is exactly the same as the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RCA</span></span> output.  It carries the same signal.  Other than having a different plug, it is wholly superfluous.  That makes the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PCR</span></span>-1 all but worthless to me and many other computer musicians.<br /><br /><br /><br />If anybody in the music technology industry is listening, please wake the fuck up and listen to your customers.  In the meantime I&#8217;m still not buying your crappy, bulky, overpriced controllers and audio interfaces separately.  Do you get me?  You don&#8217;t get two sales because you built a product that doesn&#8217;t properly do the integration it should.  You get no sale.  Nothing.  No dollars.<br /><br /><br /><br />Stop fucking up.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPDATE</span></span>:</strong> One company has gotten it half-right.  The <a href="http://www.audiomidi.com/common/cfm/product.cfm?Product_ID=4401">Novation Remote 25 Audio</a> does everything I want and then some.  That&#8217;s the right half.  The wrong half is that the Remote 25 Audio is $799 street.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it&#8217;s a quality bit of gear and probably worth it, but I&#8217;m not prepared to pay the extra $500 for all that &#8220;and then some.&#8221;  Owned.</p>
