<h1>Dag</h1>
<p>I could give the better part of a fuck about not being at <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etcon/">ETCon</a>, but damned if I&#8217;m not bummed about missing another great <a href="http://www.commonhouse.net/wiki/em3rg1ngl0ft/FrontPage">party</a> at <a href="http://www.dachb0den.com/">Dachb0den Labs</a>.<br/><br /><br /><br /><br />I guess I should qualify that first statement.  There are some neat people who&#8217;ll be at ETCon, and certainly the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/et2004/edemo.csp">Digital Democracy Teach-In</a> is pertinent to my interests and work.  But any event that has teach-ins is <em>bad news</em>, in my limited experience.  The whole vibe is a little too Left Coast cyberdelic for me to stomach (see Don&#160;Box of Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2004/view/e_sess/4913">&#8220;Peace, Love, and <span class="caps"><span class="caps">XML</span></span>&#8221;</a> talk Wednesday; and <em>that&#8217;s</em> in the clearly-tacked-on-because-oh-shit-the-DotCom-bubble-burst-justify-this-BS-quick <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/28/track_products.html">&#8220;Products &amp; Services&#8221;</a> track).<br/><br /><br /><br /><br />Or let&#8217;s put it this way: if I&#8217;m not taking my pasty, sun-starved, East Coast ass all the way out west for <a href="http://www.defcon.org/">DefCon</a>, where the drugs are most certainly better, what makes you think I&#8217;m shelling out to O&#8217;Reilly?</p>
