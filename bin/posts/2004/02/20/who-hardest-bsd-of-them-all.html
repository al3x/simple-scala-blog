<h1>Who&#8217;s The Hardest BSD of Them All?</h1>
<p>The mi2g Intelligence Unit, their goofy name previously unbeknownst to me, has <a href="http://www.mi2g.net/cgi/mi2g/frameset.php?pageid=http%3A//www.mi2g.net/cgi/mi2g/press/190204_2.php">dubbed Mac <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span> the &#8220;world\&#8217;s safest operating system&#8221;</a>, while getting in a few jabs at Linux\&#8217;s security track record.</p><br /><br /><p>Meanwhile, OpenBSD seems to be <a href="http://www.deadly.org/article.php3?sid=20040220085910">paying more attention to niggling license details</a> than security or performance, both of which have recently been called into question.  I know I wouldn\&#8217;t really think of running OpenBSD as a production server these days, save maybe as a firewall or <span class="caps"><span class="caps">IDS</span></span> box.  Given that I used to host this domain on an OpenBSD not three years ago, that\&#8217;s kinda sad.</p>
