<h1>The Joy of iChat Photo Icons</h1>
<p>Ted Leung <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2004/02/20#823">writes</a> about his impressions of the pervasive use of photographs throughout Mac <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span>, particularly in iChat.  I love it, personally.  Unlike most <span class="caps"><span class="caps">AIM</span></span> users I know, I keep a pretty trim buddy list, just those with whom I regularly speak.  I have real photographs of all of them.  I\&#8217;ll even request photographs from the buddies I don\&#8217;t know that well (classmates and campus acquaintances), a request most seem to find bemusingly eccentric (&#8220;Mac users are the <em>craazzzzziest</em> people&#8221;).  In turn, I use a photograph of myself as my buddy icon, something most <span class="caps"><span class="caps">AIM</span></span> users find puzzling.</p><br /><br /><p>iChat and the other photo-enabled applications on Mac <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span> like Mail and Address Book encourage, I believe, a more personal use of potentially impersonal technologies.  It\&#8217;s harder to adopt an &#8220;AIM facade&#8221; or attitude when you\&#8217;re chatting with friends you can see a picture of, and that\&#8217;s a good thing.  I think there\&#8217;s something lonely about having 150 people on your buddy list you hardly ever talk to, their only visible faces a borrowed Homestar Runner icon or whatnot.</p><br /><br /><p>And, as Ted points out, the photographs are a useful visual cue.  I never need to know people\&#8217;s goofy screennames, and I can quickly pick out important correspondence in Mail by looking for messages that display the author\&#8217;s photo, stored handily in my Address Book even though I only ever entered it in iChat.  It\&#8217;s a human touch and a humane touch all in one; one of those great Mac things.</p>
