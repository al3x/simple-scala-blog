<h1>SG Misdeeds?</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.funkatron.com/">Ed</a> <a href="http://www.al3x.net/archives/2004/02/19/the-porn-post/#comment-267">points out</a> <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/community/sgirls/62020.html">some evidence</a> of murmurings I had heard about SG models not being well-treated (that is, not paid well or in a timely fashion, not abused during photoshoots or something ghastly like that).  Shoot, guess it&#8217;s not guilt-free after all.  At least SG seems to have inspired a host of sites in the same vein who, according to the thread linked above, treat their models better while maintaining a pro-girl attitude and indie style.  <a href="http://manicjane.com/">ManicJane</a>, raver-friendly <a href="http://www.eroticbpm.com/">Erotic <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BPM</span></span></a>, and <a href="http://fatalbeauty.com/">Fatal Beauty</a> all seem to be popular alternatives to SG&#8217;s, well, alternative.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Update:</strong> Ed is apparently a big fan of what is apparently called &#8220;altporn,&#8221; and as such is starting a <a href="http://altporn.funkatron.com/directory/">directory of altporn sites</a> to compliment his languishing <a href="http://altporn.funkatron.com">altporn blog</a>.  Who says blogs can&#8217;t connect like-minded individuals to promote positive social works? <sup>_</sup></p>
