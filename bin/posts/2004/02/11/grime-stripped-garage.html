<h1>Grime? Stripped Garage?</h1>
<p>I don\&#8217;t know quite what to call it, but the post-Garage sound of Skream has had my head nodding since I caught his January mix off <a href="http://grievousangelsoundsystem.blogspot.com/2004_02_01_grievousangelsoundsystem_archive.html#107598651193441888">Grievous Angel</a> the other day.  It does, as per a comment in that link, sound like early Autechre, just with the rhythmic influence coming from Garage rather than Hip-Hop and Acid House.  I went looking for more, and came across an <a href="http://www.hyperdub.com/softwar/plastic.cfm">interview</a> with a cat called Plasticman (not Richie &#8220;Plastikman with a goddamn K&#8221; Hawtin) who\&#8217;s deep in the scene of UK kids making this stripped-down, dark Garage.  Check it.</p>
