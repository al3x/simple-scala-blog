<h1>Jerked Around By The New Web Host</h1>
<p>I\&#8217;m pretty unhappy with my new host for this site, <a href="http://www.dr2.net">Dr2.net</a>.  While their connection is fast and they offer all the shiny, out-of-the-box cPanel features one expects from any vanilla shared host these days, their supposedly superb support has turned out to be all but worthless.  In nearly a week of support requests they haven\&#8217;t been able to fix mail filters that aren\&#8217;t being applied to my mail, nor extra mail accounts creating their folders as sub-folders of my main account that are then displayed and readable in my <span class="caps"><span class="caps">IMAP</span></span> client.  Correspondence from their &#8220;support team&#8221; (<em>cough</em>) has been in broken and nearly unintelligible English.  Not. Happy.</p><br /><br /><p>Everyone out there in the shared hosting market seems to be just another cPanel reseller, or an overused and over-extended provider like DreamHost.  Where\&#8217;s the love?</p>
