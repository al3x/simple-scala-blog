<h1>The Hot Shit</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://www.grexultra.com/">Grex <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MXF8</span></span></a> is one hot <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MIDI</span></span> controller.  Bit of an investment once you&#8217;ve had it shipped from its British maker, I imagine, but its interface has the power and elegance to turn <a href="http://www.ableton.com/">Live</a> into truly usable DJ tool.  Build quality looks superb from the demo videos available on the site.  Sure would be nice to get my hands on one for testing, but I doubt that&#8217;s gonna happen; it&#8217;s not the sort of thing one&#8217;s local Guitar Center would carry.  Still, if it works as well as it seems to it would make plunking down the money for <a href="http://www.traktor-dj.com/">Traktor</a> moot if you already rock Live (and I do).<br /><br /><br /><br />Only a couple things wrong: it&#8217;s old skool <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MIDI</span></span>, not <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MIDI</span></span>-over-USB, which means you have to buy a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">USB</span></span> adaptor for it.  Dumb.  Because of the lack of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">USB</span></span> bus power it needs a wall wart.  Dumber.  And, pet peeve, it doesn&#8217;t try to integrate an audio interface.  Can&#8217;t blame &#8216;em for that if it does its job well.  We&#8217;ll see.</p>
