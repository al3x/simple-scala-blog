<h1>Tonight&#8217;s Show: Pre-Valentine&#8217;s Heartbrake Songs</h1>
<p>What a way to start a new semester of radio shows.</p><br /><br /><p>Normally I&#8217;d be doing shows both Tuesday and Thursday, but this week is a little funny.  Tuesdays I reserve for genre explorations and more &#8220;themed&#8221; shows, and Thursdays I&#8217;m just playing whatever the hell I want.  I feel like playing songs for anyone nursing a broken heart this Valentine&#8217;s Day, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m gonna do.  You can tune in from 6-7PM <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EST</span></span> on <a href="http://wmbc.umbc.edu"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">WMBC</span></span></a>, whose <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MP3</span></span> streams should work more than not.</p><br /><br /><p>The track listing:</p><br /><br /><p><tt><pre><br />Don't Leave The Light On, Baby - Belle &amp;amp;amp; Sebastian<br />New Birds - Arab Strap<br />I Want To Be Cold - The Microphones<br />No One Will Ever Love You - The Magnetic Fields<br />To The End - Blur<br />The Concept - Teenage Fanclub<br />There's Only Me - Rob Dougan<br />Blame - Everything But The Girl<br />Sour Times (Live at Roseland, NYC) - Portishead<br />T.O.J. - El-P<br />Anywhere Anyone - Dntel<br />The New - Interpol<br /></pre></tt></p>
