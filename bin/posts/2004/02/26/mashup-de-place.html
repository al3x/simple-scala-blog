<h1>Mashup De Place</h1>
<p>So I ran across Stephen VanDyke\&#8217;s well-compiled <a href="http://stephenvandyke.com/2004/02/20/t4dw-tunes-for-the-weekend-every-friday/">Tunes For the Weekend</a>, a nice roundup of mashups culled from wild and wooly message boards.  Between that and all the buzz that mashup masterpiece <em>The Gray Album</em> by <a href="http://djdangermouse.com/">DJ DangerMouse</a> has gotten as of late I was all set to do a mashup show for Selection 3.  That is, until I listened to a bunch of them.</p><br /><br /><p><em>The Gray Album</em> is something else.  It is transcendental, a beautiful and artful creation as impressive as its already stellar component parts.  It is the pinnacle of what a mashup can be.  Unsurprisingly, then, it is lonely in the crowded mashup field.</p><br /><br /><p>Mashups, generally, are nothing more than party music.  Not that party music has no currency, it\&#8217;s just not valuable for long.  We use party music and move on to next weekend\&#8217;s anthems.  Nothing wrong with that.  But I say that nothing inherent about the mashup &#8220;process&#8221; imbues these audio chimeras with any further artistic merit; if DangerMouse had done a crap job of blending together The Beatles and Jay-Z, nobody would be talking.</p><br /><br /><p>And that\&#8217;s why people aren\&#8217;t talking too much about mashups anymore.  Most of the stuff Stephen links to would make a great soundtrack for your weekend partying (as he suggests), but you\&#8217;ll be sick of it by Monday.  It\&#8217;s not a quality-devoid genre, just one that requires a little something extra to really stand out.  Not to many mashup artists can be DangerMouse or even <a href="http://4trak.net/dsico/">Dsico</a>.  So you\&#8217;ll not likely be hearing mashups on Selection 3 next week.  I\&#8217;ll leave the one-weekend party music discovery to y\&#8217;all.</p><br /><br /><p>Still, I can\&#8217;t help but want to make a mashup myself, if just for the title.  It\&#8217;d be a mix of <a href="http://launch.yahoo.com/song/default.asp?songID=3367735">The Darkness</a> and <a href="http://launch.yahoo.com/song/default.asp?songID=1293089">Lil\&#8217; John</a>, and I\&#8217;d call it &#8220;I Believe In a Thing Called Crunk.&#8221;  </p><br /><br /><p>Solid gold.</p>
