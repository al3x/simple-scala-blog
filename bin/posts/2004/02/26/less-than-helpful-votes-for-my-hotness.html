<h1>The Less-Than-Helpful Votes for My Hotness</h1>
<p>It may be flattering, but it\&#8217;s not particularly helpful that several blog buddies (<a href="http://www.makeoutcity.com/Archives/2004/02/24/160600/#e20040224160600p2">Jay</a>, then <a href="http://www.justagwailo.com/filter/2004/02/25/hotties">Richard</a>, and a good while earlier <a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/~allanf/2004_02_01_journal3.html#107655492691043186">Allan</a>) have deemed me a hottie.  Flattering because, well, duh; [insert ego-balancing self-effacing remark here].  Not helpful because these blog buddies are all, to the best of my knowledge, <strike>straight and</strike> male.</p><br /><br /><p>Commenting on this in a chat, a friend said I should be more open-minded.  I may have to be, since my apparent hotness seems to only carry cred with bloggers and the sort of college girls who have a decided, perhaps preconceived and strategically unified, absence from my campus.  They know they can\&#8217;t resist my &#8220;pouty, but too serious&#8221; (same friend) charms, so they stay on fancy liberal arts campuses, cloistering themselves in with endless dull deconstructionist readings of <em>whatever</em> that their aging \&#8217;67 radlib professors assign them in bales, looking up from their highlighters pulled from Kate Spade bags just long enough to let out a small sigh of longing, thinking verboten thoughts of al3x before moving on to the next turgid, self-indulgent paragraph.</p><br /><br /><p>It\&#8217;s a great world, here in my head.</p>
