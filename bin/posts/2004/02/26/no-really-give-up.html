<h1>No, Really, Give Up</h1>
<p>So <a href="http://5dots.net/">5dots</a> was all &#8220;you\&#8217;ve gotta listen to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000089CJI/qid=1077775620//ref=pd_ka_1/103-5528327-4539016?v=glance&amp;s=music&amp;n=507846">that Postal Service album</a>; if anybody I know will like it, it\&#8217;s you.&#8221;  I get up, move <em>all the way</em> from the living room to my room for the good speakers, and have myself a listen.  And I get where the big 5\&#8217;s coming from: it has most of the things an al3x, in theory, would like: synths, beats, indie vocals, shimmery production, a New Wave vibe, etc.  You\&#8217;d think I\&#8217;d be down.  You\&#8217;d think wrong.</p><br /><br /><p>Maybe I\&#8217;ve just taken a liking to the Dntel (the programming behind <span class="caps"><span class="caps">TPS</span></span>) solo album too much, but I can only think of one thing when listening to <em>Give Up</em>: shut up, Ben Gibbard.  Shut up and stop ruining these shimmery electro beats with your goofy-ass songwriter storytelling.</p><br /><br /><p>That\&#8217;s not entirely fair, of course, as Gibbard\&#8217;s songwriting has its moments.  But his voice seems like more of an annoyance than anything else after the first few tracks.  No, that\&#8217;s not because I\&#8217;m one of those <em>techno</em> fans who doesn\&#8217;t like <em>voices</em> in his music.  It\&#8217;s because Gibbard needs to mature as a songwriter and explore a bit more as a singer.</p><br /><br /><p>Dntel\&#8217;s shit is pretty much perfect.  Maybe the rest of it will grow on me, as albums tend to do.</p>
