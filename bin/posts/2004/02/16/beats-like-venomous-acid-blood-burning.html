<p>If you\&#8217;ve got any love for DJ /rupture, Kid606, Broklyn Beats, or any of the other raggabreakcore playas, grab the mix linked up <a href="http://66.227.18.130/ripley.html">right here</a> ASAP.  Like, you should have done it yesterday, and kept it on loop since then.  As if being a lady DJ whose namesake is the bad ass sister from <em>Alien</em> isn\&#8217;t enough, soundgirl Ripley goes dropping and cutting up shit you wouldn\&#8217;t even think. &lt;3.</p>
