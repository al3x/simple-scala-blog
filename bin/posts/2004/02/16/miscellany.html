<h1>Miscellany</h1>
<p>My campus only seems to flush its <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DNS</span></span> cache once every two, maybe three years.  Seriously, the rest of the net saw the new host by Thursday, and I&#8217;m still seeing the old one on campus.  Bizarre.  And I can&#8217;t seem to get a straight answer out of their <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OIT</span></span> staff.  But anyway, I&#8217;m having to go through alternate routes to post to this site and get my email, and I&#8217;m getting sick of it.</p><br /><br /><p>Happy belated Valentine&#8217;s Day.  To anyone in love, my best wishes to you and yours.  To anyone nursing a broken heart, my sympathy and solidarity.  And to anyone who&#8217;s ever taken advantage of another, male or female, physically or emotionally: fuck you.  You&#8217;ll get yours.  But mostly, best to those in love.  Make the most of it.</p><br /><br /><p>I spent the Friday evening before Valentine&#8217;s at a show on campus billed as &#8220;The Heartbreak Before Valentine&#8217;s&#8221; due to its all indie/emo lineup.  All the bands were quite good, particularly <a href="http://www.mywinternerve.com/">My Winter Nerve</a>, who despite their somewhat generic emo-band name played an enthralling and mature set that closed in a superb feedback experiment.  For all the lonelyhearts billing, I was the only person there alone.  The campus was dead quiet when I left the Commons building around 10PM.</p><br /><br /><p>Valentine&#8217;s Day itself was idled away with work and study and some music fiddling until the evening, when I went out (as is becoming seemingly routine for my Saturday nights) to Sonar, alone.  I wandered between some pretty respectable breaks in the main room and somewhat lacking 2-step in the lounge until Dieselboy took the decks shortly after midnight.  Bangin&#8217; set, good MC, crowd was amped.  I&#8217;m starting to love the routine of the end of a night at Sonar: lights go up, slip outside past the kids with fliers to the kiss of the Baltimore night air, twist and turn a few blocks and it&#8217;s ten minutes of open freeway before I&#8217;m home.  It&#8217;s nice, and I&#8217;m comfortable doing it alone.  But I may have found some fellow electronic dance music lovers at <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UMBC</span></span> to go out with, a welcome change.</p><br /><br /><p>I think the woman for me is <a href="http://www.channel4.com/life/microsites/N/nigella/">Nigella Lawson</a>, or a reasonable facsimile.  Hell, I&#8217;ll do the cooking if she&#8217;ll look that good and occasionally say something with that accent.  I&#8217;ve got a shot, right?</p><br /><br /><p>As per <a href="http://www.ableton.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6265">this thread</a> on the Ableton forums, I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to DJ with Live.  It requires a lot of prep, and I&#8217;m still getting the hang of laying warp markers, but it&#8217;s got a lot of potential.  Throw in one of <a href="http://www.audiotrak.de/eng/maya51u.html">these</a> and its a reasonably affordable and portable means for some next-level DJing.  Keen.</p>
