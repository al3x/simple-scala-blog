<h1>It&#8217;s Like I Told You</h1>
<p>I\&#8217;m lonely when I\&#8217;m not working like hell.  I guess that means I shouldn\&#8217;t stop working.</p><br /><br /><p>I listened and sung a tenor accompaniment to <a href="http://www.lyricsxp.com/lyrics/o/only_the_lonely_the_motels.html">&#8220;Only The Lonely&#8221;</a> by The Motels a few times, in part because it fit, and in part because the album it\&#8217;s from was a goodly portion of the soundtrack to my childhood; my Mom <em>loves</em> that album.  Even its emotive lyrics and melody remind me of when things were simple.</p><br /><br /><p>I thought about going back to personals sites but they make me cringe like looking at LiveJournals does; it\&#8217;s part of the Internet I wish would just disappear, strictly because of the aires and attitudes they inspire.  The same holds true for both: I\&#8217;m sure there are nice people on the personals sites and I\&#8217;m sure there are quality LJ\&#8217;ers, they just seem to be the exception.  Not going back there.</p><br /><br /><p>I\&#8217;m lonely, but at the same time very confident.  I feel like no matter what I decide to do I\&#8217;m going to do well, and I want to be with somebody just as confident and driven.  I\&#8217;ve previously been attracted to &#8220;quirky&#8221; girls, geeky and &#8220;alternative&#8221; girls, but so many of them either lack direction and self-assurance despite their smarts or take too much stock in their alt-appeal (you know the type, the self-glorifying and self-indulgent arty girl whose new sculpture-cum-installation you just <em>have</em> to see, she says, hands engaged in sweeping gestures).  I\&#8217;ve got no patience for that, and no patience for the rest of the little girls around me, taking their sweet time to grow up and evolve self-respect and motivation (not that my male peers are any better).</p><br /><br /><p>I guess it\&#8217;s going to be a problem for me as long as my primary social scene is school.  I\&#8217;m attracted to professional, pulled-together women, yet I\&#8217;m presently surrounded with people trying to make their first steps into the adult world, no less in the coddling, insipid environment of an American university.  Needle in a haystack.</p><br /><br /><p>All that sounds a little more bitter than I intended.  A lot more bitter, even.  I don\&#8217;t really begrudge my peers their gradual, easy-paced transition to adulthood.  If anything, as I\&#8217;ve written, I should probably lighten up and be more like them, though I think that window has long since closed for me.</p><br /><br /><p>I know it will be worth the wait to find a partner who is truly a <em>partner</em>, a woman with whom I can share love and respect.  In the interim, however, it feels every day like I\&#8217;m not doing enough to search this partner out, and it aches not to be able to love someone.  Like Slug says, &#8220;if you\&#8217;ve got a lot of love to give, and you don\&#8217;t know who to give it to&#8230;&#8221;</p><br /><br /><p>You work, I guess.</p>
