<h1>Selection 3 Tonight: Live Dubby Sexy Tech-House Mix!</h1>
<p>If you haven\&#8217;t taken the time to check out my show thusfar this semester, I can\&#8217;t entirely blame you.  I\&#8217;ve had some nice selections, but not proper mixes, nothing to write blog nor home about.  Tonight, however, is worth tuning in for.</p><br /><br /><p>I\&#8217;ve spent many an hour I didn\&#8217;t really have putting together this mix in Ableton Live, the technical details of which I\&#8217;ve praised and bemoaned on this blog over the past weeks.  Mapping out tracks in Live is painstaking work, much more so than marking up a crate of records with BPMs and cue points on the label.  The results, however, are more than worth it, as I can blend together multiple tracks, effects, samples, and more without thinking too much about beatmatching &#8211; that work is done upfront.</p><br /><br /><p>However, the conditions for tonight\&#8217;s mix are less than ideal.  I have no multichannel audio interface (yet) with which to cue/prelisten, and I have no hardware <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MIDI</span></span> controller for extra hands-on tweaking.  The first is more of an issue than the latter, as it leaves me &#8220;mixing blind,&#8221; but I\&#8217;m confident enough in my track order that I believe the transitions will be clean.</p><br /><br /><p>Of course, for all my fretting about technical details, all you guys care about is the music.  I\&#8217;ve got an hour of smooth, sexy, funky, dubby tech-house selections for your ears tonight.  If you\&#8217;re a fan of the genre then I need say no more, but if you\&#8217;re not, you will be after this mix.  This sort of tech-house fits somewhere between loungey downtempo and dancefloor house, though it\&#8217;s more likely to have you nodding in your chair than shaking your ass.  It\&#8217;s relaxing atmospheric music, and while I\&#8217;ve said this about other styles, it\&#8217;s perfect for sipping a cocktail or necking with a favorite SO.  You\&#8217;ll find something to like about it, no doubt.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tune in from 8 &#8211; 9PM <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EST</span></span> on <a href="http://wmbc.umbc.edu/"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">WMBC</span></span></a></strong>.  I\&#8217;ll be recording this mix inside Live and making an <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MP3</span></span> free of DJ chatter available for those of you who can\&#8217;t catch the show or want to keep this mix around.</p><br /><br /><p>As a side note, Selection 3 will henceforth only air on Tuesdays at the 8 &#8211; 9PM <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EST</span></span> timeslot.  <span class="caps"><span class="caps">WMBC</span></span> doesn\&#8217;t receive enough &#8220;RPM&#8221; (electronic) radio promos to keep us in fresh selections, and I\&#8217;d rather bring you guys a quality Live mix once a week rather two so-so iTunes mixes twice a week.</p>
