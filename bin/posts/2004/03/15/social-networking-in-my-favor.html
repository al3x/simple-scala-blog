<h1>Social Networking&#8230; In My Favor!</h1>
<p>I have a date this coming Friday night because she found me via Orkut.  I take back&#8230; well, I take back none of the bad things I said about Orkut, because they were funny.  But it\&#8217;s neat that it did what it\&#8217;s supposed to, with the networking and the socializing.</p>
