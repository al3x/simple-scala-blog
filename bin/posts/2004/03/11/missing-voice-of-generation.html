<h1>Missing Voice of a Generation</h1>
<p>Richard <a href="http://www.justagwailo.com/filter/2004/03/09/means">beat me to blogging</a> the Salon <a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2004/03/02/marty_beckerman/index_np.html">interview</a> with author Marty Beckerman, whose <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743471091/qid=1078974094/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1_xs_books_i1_xgl14/104-3988139-9272749?v=glance&amp;s=books">new book</a> <em>Generation S.L.U.T</em> aims to explore teenage sex and the problems there-associated.</p><br /><br /><p>I was not, in my teenage years, part of the kind of social circle Beckerman half-recounts and half-fictionalizes.  I had a lot of sex in high school, but with one monogamous partner in a committed relationship.  I saw the sexual culture Beckerman describes on the periphery of my tiny teenage life, however, and I see its continuation into the college years on a daily basis.  It bothered me then when I didn\&#8217;t have to deal with it, disgusts me now that I\&#8217;m looking for a relationship, and yet I felt and do feel very much in the minority, that perhaps my perception of my peers\&#8217; activities and attitudes was skewed.</p><br /><br /><p>Beckerman makes the assertions I\&#8217;ve longed wished some young writer would make.  A poignant example: &#8220;Generation Y is one of depressingly few emotional attachments, and this is leading to a total lack of cultural identity&#8212;primarily manifesting itself in a vapid, psychologically hollow sex scene, but also apparent in increased rates of self-mutilation and sexual violence.&#8221;  He attributes this lack of cultural identity in no small part to the shoddy relativism, warped feminism, and other failed intellectual initiatives of the Boomer generation &#8211; our parents\&#8217; generation (my inference, not his).  </p><br /><br /><p>Beckerman\&#8217;s is a view I\&#8217;ve long held, even bounced off some Boomers to murmurs of potential guilt, and it\&#8217;s nice to hear it echoed by someone (nearly) my age.  It\&#8217;s nice as well that Beckerman\&#8217;s no puritan, no racist, no sexist, no anything categorizable.  He\&#8217;s not advocating a platform, just recognizing a problem in his generation, a generation he genuinely seems to want to like, a generation he wants to do the right thing.  I\&#8217;m reading my personal views into his words, perhaps, but there seems present in him a kind of pragmatism coupled with classically Liberal values that is all too rare in thinkers of any generation.</p><br /><br /><p>I\&#8217;ll write more when I\&#8217;ve read the book, which I\&#8217;d like to find time to do sometime in the next twenty to thirty years (read: I\&#8217;m busy).  But meantime the interview is worth a read, chased with <a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/letters/2004/03/06/beckerman_response/index_np.html">a response</a> by Beckerman that offers his perspective on the interviewer\&#8217;s fairly apparent bias in the piece.</p>
