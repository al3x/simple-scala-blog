<h1>Festivals!</h1>
<p>I won\&#8217;t write too much because neither site has a proper lineup listed, but both Baltimore\&#8217;s local <a href="http://www.oncetwicesound.com/html/htmlenter.html">Once.Twice</a> festival of experimental electronic music and the world-renowned <a href="http://www.mutek.ca/index-en.html">Mutek</a> festival in Montreal are coming in the next few months, and I intend to be at both of them.  </p><br /><br /><p>I went to a couple of last year\&#8217;s Once.Twice events and they were great fun, and this year promises the likes of Akufen, Dabrye, <span class="caps"><span class="caps">AGF</span></span>, and other glitchy notables.  I want to attend all three days of performances this year.</p><br /><br /><p>Mutek\&#8217;s 2004 lineup is still something of a mystery, but rumor has it that Richie Hawtin will be there in his Plastikman guise.  I\&#8217;m not particularly plussed about his most recent <em>Closer</em>, nor did I find his DJ performance to be the spiritual, transcendent experience it\&#8217;s been billed as, but it\&#8217;s always interesting to see what notables are doing.  Mutek has a great reputation, and its host city of Montreal an even better one, so I\&#8217;m really looking forward to this, pretty much my first real vacation in well over a year.</p><br /><br /><p>More thoughts when final lineups are posted.  And don\&#8217;t even talk to me about Coachella or the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">WMC</span></span>.  Yes, I know who\&#8217;s there, all of them.  No I can\&#8217;t go.  Yes, I desperately want to.  <em>Le sigh</em>.</p>
