<h1>Rekkid Envy; SoulTorrent?</h1>
<p>No, not like vinyl, just in general.  When I read (mostly British) music bloggers like <a href="http://grievousangelsoundsystem.blogspot.com/">Grevious Angel</a>, <a href="http://tufluv.blogspot.com/">Tufluv</a>, and <a href="http://blissout.blogspot.com/">Blissblog</a> it becomes painfully apparent just how bloody <em>stagnant</em> my record collection is, both for not putting time and money into it and not being near good physical distribution (read: music stores).  I\&#8217;m ripping away at the paltry few promos we get at the radio station and I\&#8217;m throwing my virtual cash at sites like Warp\&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bleep.com/">Bleep</a>, but I\&#8217;m still utterly backlogged on my already-outdated &#8220;music to find&#8221; list.  This would be an actual issue if I was making my living DJing; as it stands, however, it\&#8217;s just a minor existential crisis for a sometimes-DJ.</p><br /><br /><p>The Brits seem to have it right.  They get the first harvest of engaging new electronic and urban music because it grows in their backyards.  You\&#8217;ll occasionally hear a Brit lament not getting some radio R&amp;B jam for a couple months after it hits US airwaves, but they\&#8217;re not exactly fuming over it.  I\&#8217;m just echoing my sentiments about <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BBC</span></span> Radio 1 the other day: it amazes me just how prevalent electronic music is over there, and I\&#8217;m jealous.</p><br /><br /><p>I\&#8217;ve said it before, but I\&#8217;ll say it again: <span class="caps"><span class="caps">P2P</span></span> ain\&#8217;t helping.  You read articles about DJs in China being able to spin Western dance tracks they found online and fostering a new techno community, but I\&#8217;d love to know how and where they\&#8217;re finding this stuff.  With queues in Soulseek often hundreds of downloaders deep and a protocol so shoddy you can barely browse other user\&#8217;s files, that one well-known resource for obscure music online is next to broken.</p><br /><br /><p>I\&#8217;ve had half a mind to start a BitTorrent-based alternative to SoulSeek, not dissimilar to <a href="http://www.suprnova.org/">Suprnova</a>: users contribute torrents that are categorized and indexed, and &#8220;popular&#8221; electronic and quirky music gets around.  The downside, of course, is that it might hurt small labels.  It comes back to the essential <span class="caps"><span class="caps">P2P</span></span> argument: is a download where there is no chance of a sale stealing?  If I don\&#8217;t own turntables and a label with a tight 12&#8221; out a) isn\&#8217;t releasing a CD, b) isn\&#8217;t going to sell those tracks online, either on their own site or via Emusic or the iTMS, then I\&#8217;m never gonna hear that track and I\&#8217;m never gonna get to play it for anyone else.  But practical arguments aside, that ain\&#8217;t the law.</p><br /><br /><p>What do you all think?  SoulTorrent?  Legit or shit?</p>
