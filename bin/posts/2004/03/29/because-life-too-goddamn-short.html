<h1>Because Life\&#8217;s Too Goddamn Short</h1>
<p>I shelled out for a copy of <a href="http://www.nativeinstruments.de/index.php?traktor2_us">Traktor 2.5</a>, academically priced (gonna make the most of that schoolin\&#8217; while I can).  It sure ain\&#8217;t perfect, but it\&#8217;s conducive to me getting my mix on.  With Ableton Live I needed about a four hour block to map out an hour long mix before even running through it.  In Traktor, I need maybe half an hour, if that.</p><br /><br /><p>Live is still a better choice (really, the only choice) for people doing complex mixes with multiple tracks + samples + effects, or realtime remixes of their own work incorporated into DJ sets.  If I was more serious about DJing and music-making it\&#8217;d be worth the time in spades.  But mixing is relaxation for me when I get the chance to do it, so a tool that I don\&#8217;t have to fight with is the tool I\&#8217;m using.</p><br /><br /><p>I\&#8217;ve been playing with Traktor via an <a href="http://www.evolution.co.uk/products/evo_xsession.htm">Evolution X-Session UC-17</a>, which is an adequate <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MIDI</span></span> controller but no replacement for a DJ mixer; its layout in no way reflects the decks-plus-mixer interface of Traktor.  But at the end of the day the X-Session is a bank of knobs and a crossfader, which gets the job done of  controlling (and, by extension, recording) all of Traktor\&#8217;s <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MIDI</span></span>-assignable functions.  In using a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MIDI</span></span> controller you may lose the familiarity of a DJ mixer, but you gain control of some of Traktor\&#8217;s added goodies like looping and filters.</p><br /><br /><p>What would be ideal, of course, is a real DJ mixer that also sends <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MIDI</span></span> data out from its knobs and sliders.  The gorgeous <a href="http://www.em411.com/show.php?area=alert&amp;area_id=678">Allen &amp; Heath Xone 92</a> fits that bill, but is hideously expensive.  The Traktor community talks endlessly about custom controllers but little has surfaced, unsurprisingly.  I\&#8217;ll continue to use the X-Session in lieu of a real mixer or specialized controller, but if I had cash burning a hole in my pocket just a little smaller than the Xone 92 I\&#8217;d think about <a href="">one of these</a>.  I\&#8217;ve always wanted that mixer, digital mixing or not.</p><br /><br /><p>At any rate, it\&#8217;s nice not to lay warp markers until my hands ache.</p>
