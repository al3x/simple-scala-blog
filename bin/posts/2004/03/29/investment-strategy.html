<h1>Investment Strategy</h1>
<p>I&#8217;d like to start getting into investing in a big way.  I&#8217;m mostly interested in buying some solid, moderate-return mutuals for starters before I get into riskier ventures.  I&#8217;m doing my Google homework, but any readers have financial web sites or resources they find essential?  Any investing blogs, that sort of thing?  Thanks kids.</p>
