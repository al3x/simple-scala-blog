<h1>No Low-Carb Slippage!</h1>
<p>I tried letting the Atkins slip a bit, indulging in an occasional tortilla or even (gasp!) sandwich, and it hasn\&#8217;t turned out well.  I haven\&#8217;t put on any weight as a result, but any gradual &#8220;Phase 3&#8221; weight loss I had going has stopped.  On days I ate more carbs I noticed a loss of focus and a significant drop in energy levels, and I generally just felt gross.  A sandwich sure is more convenient than an Atkins lunch, but it\&#8217;s not worth it.</p><br /><br /><p>I\&#8217;ve been considering looking into the less-restrictive South Beach diet.  One way or another I seem to need a low-carb regimen to stay slim and keep my blood sugar level, but I can\&#8217;t help but worry about the fat-centric aspects of Atkins.  My impression is that South Beach is a &#8220;healthier&#8221; diet (in the low fat sense that we\&#8217;ve all been taught) that still kicks out bad carbs.</p><br /><br /><p><a href="http://iheartmena.typepad.com/">Jon</a> has just set up a blog/community site for all things low-carb over at <a href="http://www.carbwire.com/">Carbwire</a>, which is diet agnostic in favoring neither Atkins nor South Beach and generally nifty.  Resources like that are helping me stick with the &#8220;low-carb lifestyle,&#8221; which I maintain as being worthwhile if you\&#8217;re one of us unfortunates with slug-speed metabolisms.</p>
