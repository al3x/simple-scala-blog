<p><a href="http://www.picnet.net/">PICnet</a>\&#8217;s joint session with Democracy in Action at the <a href="http://organizenow.net/conference04.html">Grassroots Use of Technology</a> conference at <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MIT</span></span> this past weekend was <a href="http://www.corante.com/loose/archives/002393.html">blogged</a> over at Corante\&#8217;s Loose Democracy.  I wasn\&#8217;t present, but fellow PICnet\&#8217;ers Ryan and Ann were there to talk up our idea of <strong>distributed campaigns</strong>, which I\&#8217;ve been building the software to make happen.</p><br /><br /><p>I\&#8217;ve been putting off talking about my work here, but now that the cat is out of the bag blog-wise I\&#8217;d guess I\&#8217;d better start talking.  You\&#8217;ll get a post soon.</p>
