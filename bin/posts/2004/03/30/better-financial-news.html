<h1>Better Financial News</h1>
<p>I really loathe <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CNBC</span></span>, the only financial news channel we get on our free university cable package.  Every time I turn it on they&#8217;ve got Dennis Miller, reruns of <em>The Apprentice</em>, bad <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MSNBC</span></span> rebroadcasted news, or something equally inane.  When I want financial news I want numbers and commentary on those numbers and not a helluva lot else.  Particularly not Dennis Miller.  <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CNBC</span></span> fails me.</p><br /><br /><p>Thankfully I can get <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/media/tv/index.html">Bloomberg TV</a> as a free (with commericals) Real stream at a reasonable resolution.  They do good coverage, interrupting the flow of market data only for relevant, market-impacting business and world news.  They&#8217;ve got nice glitchy beats soundtracking their station spots.  And what&#8217;s more, they&#8217;ve implemented <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CNBC</span></span>&#8217;s only really good idea: attractive female hosts and correspondents.  Pretty ladies + superb economic analysis = happy al3x.</p><br /><br /><p>I&#8217;m collecting streams of all varieties, audio and video, because Phil and I will most likely eschew a television and cable for his 17&#8221; iMac set up in our living room as a makeshift media center machine.  Nothin&#8217; but streams and whatever we can find on BitTorrent.  That&#8217;s all I need if I can live without The Daily Show and Adult Swim (the only non-news <span class="caps"><span class="caps">TV I</span></span> watch), and I very much can.</p>
