<h1>A Costly Mistake, Said The Lady At The Apple Store</h1>
<p>No shit, bitch.</p><br /><br /><p>I went and left my iBook\&#8217;s power adaptor at home for the first time ever.  <em>Ever</em>.  I must be stressed, because this is the second time in as many days that I\&#8217;ve left something at home (yesterday it was my keys).  I just don\&#8217;t do that sort of thing.</p><br /><br /><p>My descending premature Alzheimer\&#8217;s aside, why the devil are Apple power adaptors US$80.00?!  I understand they\&#8217;re compact and well-designed, but do they really cost that much to build?  It\&#8217;s not like it\&#8217;s a captive market for Apple; there are plenty of third-party power adaptors out there.  Puzzling.</p>
