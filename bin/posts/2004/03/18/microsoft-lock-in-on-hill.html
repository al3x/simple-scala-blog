<h1>Microsoft Lock-In On The Hill</h1>
<p>Here\&#8217;s a thing you probably wouldn\&#8217;t know unless you\&#8217;re unfortunate enough to be in the tiny DC political web development business: hosting for Congressional web sites is strictly on the Microsoft server platform.  Strictly.  As in, even if a Congressperson wanted their site powered by <span class="caps"><span class="caps">LAMP</span></span>, they couldn\&#8217;t have it.  Instead, it\&#8217;s all <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ASP</span></span> and <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MSSQL</span></span>.  No choice.</p><br /><br /><p>That\&#8217;s not a good thing for any number of political (in the non-professional sense) reasons, but mostly for fiscal ones.  It means shops like ours can\&#8217;t deliver the best possible service and end-product at the lowest cost.  I would argue that it also limits constituents\&#8217; electronic access to their representatives by making it more costly and difficult to develop innovative web applications for connecting voters.  And while some <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ASP</span></span> developers would disagree, I imagine, I strongly believe that open source is the strongest foundation for technology projects in the public interest.  Open <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ASP</span></span> projects &#8220;count,&#8221; of course, but the ideal platform is one open from system to application layer.</p><br /><br /><p>I\&#8217;d like to see Congresspersons get their choice of hosting platforms.  It won\&#8217;t happen.</p>
