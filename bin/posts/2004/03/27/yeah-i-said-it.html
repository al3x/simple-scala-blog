<h1>Yeah, I Said It</h1>
<p>Fuck Noam Chomsky and fuck his blog.  Thankyew.</p><br /><br /><p>[UPDATE, by popular demand]: My explanation for the above comment is that Chomsky has become a career activist intellectual, eager to lay blame and spread his agenda.  I hate that, and by extension the fact that everyone is going nuts over him blogging.  I\&#8217;m no centrist, but the worst kind of &#8220;radical&#8221; (though there\&#8217;s nothing radical about Chomsky and his ideas anymore) is one who manipulates and disengages potential participants in the processes of government and civic life that actually further change, like voting.  People who don\&#8217;t know any better (angry high school kids) read Chomsky and his ilk, on the left or right, and it cements their alienation from viable avenues of social betterment.  And that\&#8217;s tragic.</p><br /><br /><p>Hence the blunt statement.</p>
