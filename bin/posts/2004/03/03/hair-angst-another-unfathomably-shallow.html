<h1>Hair Angst (Another Unfathomably Shallow Post)</h1>
<p>From whence did I acquire this curse?  Why is it that I walk into a salon and tell the stylist &#8220;it used to be spiky; I really didn\&#8217;t like it that way,&#8221; and walk out with spiky hair?  I know I talk softly in some social situations, but I think I\&#8217;m intelligible when I state my preference for anything but spikes.  And certainly my stylist at Tenpachi (rated Baltimore\&#8217;s best salon by the Baltimore City Paper in 2003, a designation I fear is all too accurate) spoke fluent English.  As the barber cape went on and the scissors came out I could see no barrier, other than lack of specificity on my part, preventing me from getting <em>not the spiky haircut again</em>, particularly not the militarily-short-on-the-sides version of the spiky haircut I\&#8217;m now cursed with for the next few weeks.</p><br /><br /><p>It\&#8217;s not terminal, of course.  I\&#8217;ve looked worse.  It\&#8217;s nice to have short hair in the newly-warm weather.  And I can\&#8217;t wear hats to save my life, so it\&#8217;s not like I\&#8217;m going to cover it up while it grows out.  Moreover, Tenpachi\&#8217;s gimmick is that they aim to offer salon-caliber cuts at a mere $10.00; they didn\&#8217;t exactly deliver on that,  but nor did I spend a lot for this coiffure failure.</p><br /><br /><p>I need to find a hair place that delivers consistently.  I\&#8217;m guessing that place will not be in Baltimore.  And wherever I find this place, I need some way to convey with absolute crystalline certainty just how much I don\&#8217;t want to walk out of there with spiky hair.  Messy, sure.  Spiky, no.  Perhaps if I employ a Stewie from Family Guy policy: &#8220;for every spike I find, I shall kill you.&#8221;</p>
