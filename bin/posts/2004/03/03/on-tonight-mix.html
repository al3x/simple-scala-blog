<h1>On Tonight&#8217;s Mix</h1>
<p>I had a blast doing tonight\&#8217;s mix, but if you were tuned in you probably heard me cursing my software more than enjoying myself.  Live gave me a few fits and starts, mostly in the warp marker department.  I hadn\&#8217;t mapped out a couple of tracks as well as I had thought and they started pitching all over the place, like a toddler playing with the speed control on a record player.  I had to make a couple of quick exits due to those warping issues, and a couple of times I just mis-clicked.  Still, for not having any cueing capabilities nor even a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MIDI</span></span> crossfader there were some pretty smooth transitions in there.  I\&#8217;m really excited about what I\&#8217;ll be able to do with hardware assistance and more practice.</p><br /><br /><p>But as for the small matter of the recording of the set: obviously I\&#8217;m not putting a botched mix out there for y\&#8217;all.  I\&#8217;m gonna clean it up, even switch out a couple of the tracks (Pole\&#8217;s &#8220;Slow Motion (Instrumental)&#8221; at the beginning is a nice track, but jumping from 77 to 122 <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BPM</span></span> just doesn\&#8217;t jive), and then I\&#8217;ll post the new mix for your listening pleasure.</p><br /><br /><p>Thanks again to those of you who tuned in!</p>
