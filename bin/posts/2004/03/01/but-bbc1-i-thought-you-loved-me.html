<h1>But BBC1, I Thought You Loved Me!</h1>
<p>It\&#8217;s nothing new, but the streaming <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/dance/">dance shows available on the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BBC1</span></span></a> bring a little bit of joy into my life.  I know Brits seem to think of the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BBC</span></span> as too commercial, and the dance music they play as sell-out crap, but here across the pond the very idea that a real radio station would really play electronic dance music for real is unfathomably great.  The famous <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BBC1</span></span> shows like Pete Tong\&#8217;s Essential Selection, Judge Jules\&#8217; show, and a host of others all offer top-notch dance fair, fun and new and enthusiastically hosted.  Some of the odd-hours shows like <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/dance/breezeblock/tracklistings.shtml?focuswin">The Breezeblock</a> have more eclectic fair, such as this week\&#8217;s showcase of <a href="http://ghostlyinternational.com/">Ghostly International</a> artists.  Plus, they can swear on their radio.</p><br /><br /><p>But with the Breezeblock in my headphones, I\&#8217;m amazed that anyone on the style-whorin\&#8217; British Isles is still buying into retro-\&#8217;80s crap like \&#8217;Muscle Car\&#8217; by Mylo, yet another insipidly electrosexual throwaway track.  Thankfully, selections like that are few and far between on the superb <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BBC1</span></span> dance shows.  Don\&#8217;t pass up <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/urban/bobbyandnihal/">Bobby Friction + Nihal</a>\&#8217;s bangin\&#8217; Asian beats show; I sweat that desi-hop shit.</p>
