<h1>This Year&#8217;s Model</h1>
<p>The Gentoo crew just <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng/">got their release on</a> with Gentoo 2004.0 (<em>nice</em> versioning schema: year first, counting up the quarters from zero like true geeks).  With ports for x86, <span class="caps"><span class="caps">AMD64</span></span>, PowerPC, <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SPARC</span></span>, and <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MIPS</span></span> there\&#8217;s no excuse for not trying it if you\&#8217;re unhappy with your present Linux distro or other OS.  I\&#8217;d be installing this <em>right now</em> if I had a spare machine.  I may go find a computer in my school\&#8217;s library and install it on that while nobody\&#8217;s looking.  Gentoo is just that hot.</p><br /><br /><p>Link from <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=6206">OSNews</a>, which took a break from posting twelve embarrassingly-written defenses of Linux on the desktop per day to actually bring us some OS news.</p>
