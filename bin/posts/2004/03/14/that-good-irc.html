<h1>That&#8217;s Good IRC</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.javelin.cc/colloquy/index.html">Colloquy</a> is such an unfathomably good <span class="caps"><span class="caps">IRC</span></span> client it\&#8217;s &#8230; unfathomable.  I cannot fathom it.  Presently not fathoming.  So forth.</p><br /><br /><p>It\&#8217;s for <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span> and acts like it all proper.  It makes <span class="caps"><span class="caps">IRC</span></span> pretty so you can ignore the inane conversations.  It is good and free and open and righteous.</p>
