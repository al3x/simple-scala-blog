<h1>Even The Fucked Up Rabbit Face Wasn&#8217;t That Cool</h1>
<p>There\&#8217;s a <a href="http://visionsdc.com/dyno/index.asp">theater</a> here in DC that plays <em><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0246578/">Donnie Darko</a></em> seemingly whenever possible.  It\&#8217;s a cult film that always came at high recommendation (mostly from hipster kids) that I never got around to watching until tonight.</p><br /><br /><p>For a movie so chock-full of empty signifiers it sure likes to pretend that something significant is going on.  If any of those lousy hipsters who recommended this to me &#8211; or maybe the director &#8211; had done the proper retro-\&#8217;80s homework they\&#8217;d know that David Lynch did every goddamn thing <em>Darko</em> tries to accomplish with far greater creepy suburban surrealism in <em>Twin Peaks</em> (voted &#8220;least probable thing to be aired on network television since ever&#8221;).  No points for the weird time-warp tunnel effects, slick editing, or the fucked up rabbit costume.  Negative points for Drew Barrymore\&#8217;s lousy performance, setting it during Halloween, and depicting yet another relationship between troubled teens in which nobody really grows and sex is used strictly to (ineffectively) bandage emotional wounds.  Yawn.</p><br /><br /><p>Points only for Tears for Fears in the soundtrack.  The part where I sang along to that was great.</p>
