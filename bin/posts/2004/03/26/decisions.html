<h1>Decisions</h1>
<p>You don\&#8217;t have to read my agonizing over school vs. work anymore, because I\&#8217;m not agonizing over it anymore.</p><br /><br /><p>This evening, sooner than I thought I would, I talked things through with my parents.  I\&#8217;d decided I was taking a year leave from my university at the end of this semester one way or another, but ideally with their blessing.  I got that blessing and, what\&#8217;s more, their support and enthusiasm, limited only by good longview parental concerns about my job market viability should I not finish school.  It\&#8217;s a risk, and that much was acknowledged on both our parts, but equally understood is the potential for my success in both a business and personal sense.  They understand the pressure I wrote about a couple days ago and know just how much I enjoy the work that I\&#8217;m doing.  They\&#8217;ve got confidence in me, and were happy with the way in which I broached the the subject.  In short, everyone\&#8217;s happy.  Especially my boss.</p><br /><br /><p>So once this semester ends, I\&#8217;ll be back in Bethesda for several weeks until Phil and I move into whichever of the plentiful 2-bedroom apartments in downtown DC we decide on.  I\&#8217;ll be working full time, and thrilled to be doing so.  And you guys won\&#8217;t have to suffer any more what-ifs and related whining, nor will I.  It\&#8217;s time to just do it.  As my stepfather, a man who knows, said this evening, &#8220;opportunities don\&#8217;t hang around long.&#8221;</p><br /><br /><p>I\&#8217;m pretty damn happy right now.  And I\&#8217;m gonna go see Broken Social Scene.</p>
