<h1>Get a Job: PHP Programmer Wanted</h1>
<p>The company I work for is looking for a skilled <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PHP</span></span> programmer for roughly six weeks of contract work with the possibility of further potentially full-time work.  We\&#8217;re a small but established and rapidly growing shop located in downtown Waashington, DC providing web applications and services for government, NGOs, non-profits, and the political sector; the ideal candidate has experience and/or motivation in this field.  Past experience with <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ASP</span></span>, particularly porting <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ASP</span></span> to <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PHP</span></span>, is a major plus but not a requirement, as is experience with content management systems (CMSs).</p><br /><br /><p>We\&#8217;re looking to hire soon.  Like, yesterday.  And you\&#8217;d get to work with me (who says contracting doesn\&#8217;t come with benefits?).  If you or someone you know is interested please contact me or email <a href="mailto:jobs [at] picnet dot DIESPAM net">jobs [at] picnet dot <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DIESPAM</span></span> net</a>.</p>
