<h1>DC 4 Life</h1>
<p>SwampCity reports that <a href="http://www.swamp-city.com/archives/04/03/040324_nobody_likes_dc.php">nobody likes DC</a>.  Fuck all y\&#8217;all, I say.  Suckas don\&#8217;t even know.</p><br /><br /><p>I\&#8217;ve recently come to grips with the idea that I\&#8217;ll probably live in DC for the rest of my life.  Growing up, I always abhorred meeting people who had lived in the same place all their lives.  I was eager to move someplace different, just to <em>be</em> different.  As I\&#8217;ve travelled I\&#8217;ve found plenty of places I\&#8217;d be happy to live.  It\&#8217;s not as if I couldn\&#8217;t imagine another home than the District.  But if I stay in my present line of work (which I intend to do), that\&#8217;s going to keep me around DC.  And I\&#8217;m more than okay with that.</p><br /><br /><p>I\&#8217;ve come to love the city, even for its traffic, its endless type-A personalities, its wonky public transit, its wonks, its miserable series of mayors, its ridiculously high taxes for almost nonexistent public services, the fact that we get all the good bands mid-week after they hit <span class="caps"><span class="caps">NYC</span></span>, the travesty that is the Sunday Post, not having a vote, and so on.  It\&#8217;s inexplicable, but I love it.</p><br /><br /><p>It\&#8217;s true, as per the survey SwampCity linked to, that we\&#8217;re not the most friendly or stylish city, but we get by.  You get used to translating a steely glare on the Metro as &#8220;excuse me, I need to get by,&#8221; and a swift rabbit-punch to the kidneys as &#8220;pardon me, but I\&#8217;m really in quite a rush.&#8221;  And there are pockets of style, if you know where to look (Dupont Circle).  Maybe we\&#8217;re not <span class="caps"><span class="caps">NYC</span></span> or LA, but after weeks in Baltimore I\&#8217;m always amazed and how goddamn good the women here look.  Then again, I\&#8217;m turned on by draft legislation poking out of a Kate Spade bag, so I\&#8217;m not an impartial judge.</p><br /><br /><p>Any city is what you make it, I\&#8217;ve found.  Don\&#8217;t let anyone tell you you can\&#8217;t have fun in DC.</p>
