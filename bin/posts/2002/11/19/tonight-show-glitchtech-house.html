<h1>Tonight&#8217;s Show: Glitch/Tech-House (?)</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Musical genres get harder to place every day, particularly in the ever-mutating realm of electronic music.  Anyone who\\&#8217;s been reading this blog is probably sick of me writing the word &#8220;genre&#8221; for just that reason: at a point, influences overlap to such a degree that trying to rope off a new catagory of music is unnecessary and inaccurate.  That\\&#8217;s why I\\&#8217;m not sure how to define the sound I\\&#8217;ve chosen for my show tonight.  It all, at some point or another, has a thumping four-on-the-floor house beat.  It all has traces of the glitchy, clicks-n-cuts sound of <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">IDM</span></span></span></span>.  Some might call it experimental house or techno, some tech-house, some minimal techno.  I\\&#8217;m not sure what it is, but I love this sound: intelligent, subtle, and yet backed by ass-shaking house beats.  Just listen, and enjoy (reccomendation: turn the bass on your system <b>up</b>).</p>"<br />
