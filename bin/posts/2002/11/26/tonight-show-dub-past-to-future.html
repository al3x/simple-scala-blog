<h1>Tonight\&#8217;s Show: Dub, Past to Future</h1>
--- <br />- <p>As I mentioned in my electroclash rant, the odd spacey-bassy Jamaican<br />musical style known as dub is making a comeback, and I couldn\&#8217;t be<br />happier.  Dub was an outgrowth of reggae made possible by the<br />reverb-on-steroids &#8220;delay&#8221; effect originally intended for guitars and<br />the genius of producers like King Tubby, Lee &#8220;Scratch&#8221; Perry, and The<br />Scientist.  Dub takes reggae, slows the already ganja-drentched sound<br />down, turns up the bass, and sends the whole thing through Zion\&#8217;s own echo<br />chamber.  The result is beautiful, otherwordly, and has influenced the<br />development of music in both drastic and subtle ways, particularly in the<br />reaalm of electronic music.  Selected for your listening pleasure are some<br />of the classics of the dub genre and the future sounds they\&#8217;ve spawned.<br/><br />This is another show that calls for big bass and serious relaxation.</p><br />
