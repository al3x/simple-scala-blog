<h1>Tonight&#8217;s Show: Downtempo/Trip-Hop</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Well, they called it trip-hop when I was getting into that sexy lounge sound years ago.  Now most record shops have a &#8220;downtempo&#8221; section to cover all the permutations of the genre, from the dubbed-out worldbeat of Theivery Corporation and their ilk to exceptionally jazzy drum n\&#8217; bass, and all points and tempos in between.  Downtempo is an umbrella term over a sound that remains perpetually sucessful and mature.  By taking the most polished techniques of genres past and present, from classic jazz to skittering breakbeat, downtempo artists are never without the material to soundtrack an international spy thriller or urban romance.  It\&#8217;s hard not to love the combination of phat grooves, sinewy female vocals, and smooth sax that typifies a good trip-hop track.  I\&#8217;ve got some tight selections for tonight\&#8217;s show, so put on something black and sexy, mix a couple White Russians, grab your partner of choice, and get laid-back.</p><br />
