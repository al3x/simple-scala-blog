<h1>A Small Cup of Kofi</h1>
--- <br />- <p>Yesterday I had the privledge of seeing UN Secretary General Kofi Annan give an eloquent, if brief, talk on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the University of Maryland.  The talk was surrounded by introductions, thanks, and ceremony, but lasted itself only 15 minutes.  Presented in a lecture series on peace endowed by the widow of  asassinated Egyptian president Anwar Sadat, Annan&#8217;s speech addressed conflict resolution above all else.  And, in contrast to the divided factions protesting on <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">UMD</span></span></span></span>&#8217;s College Park campus, he gave both sides their due.  Annan described the embattled Middle East as having &#8220;an atmosphere of gloom,&#8221; in where &#8220;only those who believe in might can be confident, and they are misled.&#8221;<br /><br /><br />Annan made the conditions he sees necessary for peace quite clear.  Firstly, while recognizing both Isreali and Palestinian attatchment to their land, he posited that two states with roughly the &#8216;67 borders would be the only viable solution.  Annan sees Isreali settlers as a detriment to this process, but gave equal criticism to the &#8220;wicked&#8221; suicide bombings by pro-Palestinian terrorists.  He said the UN has a 3 year roadmap towards Palestinian statehood and an overall resolution to this conflict.  But his final and most poignant condition was the need for new leadership on both sides, a point that hopefully both Isrealis and Palestinians will take to heart.  Though brief, Annan&#8217;s presence as a speaker made worthwhile the tedious ceremony that preceded his lecture.  I&#8217;m looking forward to future lectures in the Sadat series, the next of which will be Bill Clinton, if I&#8217;m not mistaken.</p><br />
