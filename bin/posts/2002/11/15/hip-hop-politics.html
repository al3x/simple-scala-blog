<h1>Hip-Hop Politics</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>In several recent conversations, friends who know I&#8217;m a hip-hop fan asked me about the difference between rap and hip-hop.  My basic response is, &#8220;attitude; postive and negative.&#8221;  Hip-hop has a positive attitude that&#8217;s reflected in bouncing beats, playful rhymes, and a can-do political sensability.  &#8220;Gangsta&#8221; rap, in contrast, is characterized by harsh or menacing vocals, driving and repetitive drums, and a worldview consumed by money, violence, drugs, and commoditized sex (in roughly decending order of importance).  I found it interesting, then, that an <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/1114/p01s04-ussc.html\">article</a> today in the Christian Science Monitor predicts that &#8220;the hip-hop world and the gangsta world are about to collide,&#8221; as more true hip-hoppers see the need to make clear that the &#8220;gangsta fairy tale&#8221; is just that: a made up story to sell to children.</p>"<br />
