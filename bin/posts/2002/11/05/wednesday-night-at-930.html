<h1>Wednesday Night at the 9:30</h1>
--- <br />- <p>One of my first loves in the realm of electronica was <a href="http://www.ninjatune.com/">Ninjatune</a>, a largely downtempo record label without peer.  Their &#8220;Funkungfusion&#8221; compilation, which I picked up in a little record shop in Pasadena, changed my musical world.  With that in mind, I&#8217;m totally jazzed to see mad Brazilian glitch-loungehead Amon Tobin rock the <a href="http://www.930.com">9:30</a> club this Wednesday with DJ Food (actually a multi-DJ endevour given a face by two Englishmen) and Bonobo (who I&#8217;ve never heard, but has Ninjatune to rest his laurels on).  A full report will be offered.</p><br />
