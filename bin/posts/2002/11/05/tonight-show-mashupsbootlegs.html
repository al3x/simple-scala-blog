<h1>Tonight&#8217;s Show: Mashups/Bootlegs</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Well folks, it\\&#8217;s been a blogless week, and for that I apologize.  But I\\&#8217;ve put together a damn entertaining show for this evening\\&#8217;s regular broadcast on <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">WMBC</span></span></span></span>.  It\\&#8217;s an hour of mashups, aka bootlegs (or &#8220;bootys&#8221; if you\\&#8217;re really British).  Mashups are wonderful things: unlikely and illegally produced amalgamations of pop songs that add worth to otherwise dull radio fodder.  Check out a good <a href=\"http://www.nuvo.net/news/archive/001130.html\">review</a> of a typical mashup compilation album, or have a gander at <a href=\"http://www.boomselection.net\">Boom Selection</a>, the essential bootleg blog.  I\\&#8217;ve thrown in a fair variety for the evening\\&#8217;s show, so listen, enjoy, and hope the <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">FCC</span></span></span></span> isn\\&#8217;t listening too <sup>_</sup></p>"<br />
