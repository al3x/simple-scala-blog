<h1>Unamerican</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I don&#8217;t take for granted the fact that I have the safety, time, and privledge to be critical of our government; that says something good about America.  But there&#8217;s a time for critical parody, and the possibilty of war with Iraq is certainly one of them.  So when the Man finds out you&#8217;ve been dissenting you can either <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/leperous/PhotoAlbum1.html">shut your face</a> or <a href="http://bantha.cjb.net/stuffins/john/switch.php">move to Canada</a>.  It&#8217;s nice to have options.</p><br />
