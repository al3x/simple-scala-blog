<h1>Cex @ The Ottobar</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>Last night I got to see <a href=\"http://www.tigerbeat6.com\">Tigerbeat6</a> recording artist <a href=\"http://www.rjyan.com/\">Cex</a> play at the <a href=\"http://www.theottobar.com\">Ottobar</a> in his hometown of Baltimore.  Having been to many the show in my brief days, I can safely say this was the most singular performance I&#8217;ve yet seen.  Cex gets intimate with the audience; so intimate, in fact, that he&#8217;s talking with the audience about how intimate he gets with them without the whole affair dripping in irony and production.  Unlike his largely instrumental electronic discography, a Cex show is essentially a hip-hop affair: he talks for a few minutes, then plays his own pre-recorded beats from an iBook and raps along.  His rhymes are amusing and his music is decent, but the really enjoyable parts of his performance are the self-analytical impromptu conversations with the audience.  I encourage you to seek first a live Cex show, then perhaps look up his catalog if you like either whiteboy hip-hop or melodic <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">IDM</span></span></span></span> <i>ala</i> Warp Records.  The Cex mystique really can&#8217;t be explained &#8211; you need a demonstration.</p>"<br />
