<h1>Innovative Interface Design</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I&#8217;ve been used a pretty nondescript <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPU</span></span></span></span> load monitor on my Mac <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS X</span></span></span></span> system called <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/takashi_hamada/Acti/MacOSX/LoadInDock/">LoadInDock</a>, but it doesn&#8217;t provide a lot of info about my system for the amount of space it uses.  That&#8217;s why I was wowed by the Iconfactory&#8217;s <a href="http://www.iconfactory.com/ip_home.asp">iPulse</a>, an odd little nest of interlocking and concentric circles in varying colors that can tell you your <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPU</span></span></span></span> load, memory and disk usage, network stats, and even the date and time, all either in your Dock or a floating window.  So in the same space that I got information about one aspect of my computer, I now get four.  That&#8217;s effective (and innovative) interface design.</p><br />
