<h1>An Apology to FingerWorks (or how I learned to love the keyless
keyboard)</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>I was smitten with <a href=\"http://www.fingerworks.com\">FingerWorks&#8217;</a><br />TouchStream technology when I first read about it on that repository<br />(suppository?) of all things geek, Slashdot.  It&#8217;s a brilliant idea: take<br />a touchpad, make it super-duper smart with gesture support, map a keybord<br />to it, and slap the whole thing on an ergonomic frame.  You get a device<br />that lets you mouse, gesture with your fingertips for damn near every<br />keyboard shortcut you can think of, and then go right to typing without<br />moving your hands.  It did wonders for my crippling hands, and the mousing<br />and gestures were very intuitive.<br />&lt;!<del><del>more</del></del>&gt;<br /><p><br />Typing was another story.  I stumbled around the keyboard for<br />several weeks, finally calling FingerWorks with thoughts of returning the<br />ST.  I was told that one needed about five weeks to really get comfortable<br />with the key layout, so I gave it time (time past the 30 day limit on<br />returns, something of a leap of faith).  Sure enough, I got comfortable<br />with the layout, and my fingers memorized where to go for what.  But then,<br />a problem: once I was able to type quickly, the text completion firmware<br />in the keyboard had a hard time keeping up with me.  With the keys<br />being essentially &#8220;virtual,&#8221; software handles the process of figuring<br />out what the hell you&#8217;re trying to type and makes guesses; it doesn&#8217;t<br />always guess right, however, and I found<br />that frustrating.  Once again, I<br />contacted FingerWorks, and was basically told to type somewhat slowly and<br />carefully, particularly when typing non-English words (like geekisms).  In<br />a huff over my lost words per<br />minute, I shipped the ST back and went to re-explore the world of<br />mechanical keyboards and mice.<p><br />I found a miserable, finger-twisting world.  I like the keyboard<br />built into my iBook well enough, and its accompanying trackpad isn&#8217;t half<br />bad either.  But trying to find a decent mechanical keyboard that&#8217;ll fit<br />into my rather cramped dorm desk keyboard tray, and then an ergonomic<br />mouse to match, proved basically impossible.  I tried a MacAlly iceKey,<br />whose laptop-like keys make for fast input but no wrist support.  I tried<br />an Adesso Tru-Form with a built-in touchpad so awkwardly placed that it<br />nullified the benefits of the keyboard&#8217;s otherwise ergonomic layout.  In<br />the mouse department, I tried a Kensington Studio Mouse, which was simply<br />too dainty for my big hands, though very stylish.  All in all, I was left<br />longing for my TouchStream ST.  So I called FingerWorks again, and it&#8217;s<br />on its way back to me.<p><br />Ultimately, sacrificing a few extra words per minute of typing speed for<br />improved ergonomics and gesture support is entirely worthwhile.  My<br />knuckles have locked up again, being away from the TouchStream for almost<br />five days.  With that in mind, my apologies to FingerWorks, makers of the<br />best damn computer input device around.  I&#8217;m a tough customer, but the<br />ST&#8217;s price warrants some second thoughts.  It&#8217;s worth it, though.  Boy, is<br />it ever worth it <em>cracks knuckles</em>.</p>"<br />
