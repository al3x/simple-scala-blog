<h1>A Lot of Hate to Give</h1>
--- <br />- <p>I am an angry young man when it comes to anything that ends up on the<br />media radar.  If he, she, or it is in the papers and doing the talk show<br />circuit, I probably have a few brain cells devoted to despising them.  And<br />so, apparently, does the Buffalo Beast.  Their &lt;a<br />href=&#8221;http://www.buffalobeast.com/article.php?path=2002/09/&amp;article=01_0&#8221;&gt;Most<br />Loathsome People in America, 2002</a> is dead on.  I can&#8217;t disagree with a<br />single choice, their thoughts on these bastards, or their rankings.  I even<br />found some new people to hate, and new reasons to hate<br />people who already irked me.  You&#8217;ll find someone to hate too.  Happy<br />holidays.</p><br />
