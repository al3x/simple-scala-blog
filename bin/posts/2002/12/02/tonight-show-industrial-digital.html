<h1>Tonight\&#8217;s Show: Industrial -> Digital Hardcore</h1>
--- <br />- <p>This, like the noise show several weeks ago, is not a broadcast for the<br />weak of ear.  I\&#8217;m starting with a couple later-day industrial tracks, the<br />groundwork for the sound extremity that follows chronologically.  From<br />there your eardrums are gonna get pounded by some of the luminaries of the<br />Digital Hardcore world, including DH label boss Alec Empire and his Atari<br />Teenage Riot project, Japanese DH-headbangers The Mad Capsule Markets, and<br />sound aggrovators <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">EC8OR</span></span></span></span>.  Thrown in for good measure are some internet<br />unknowns and folks who\&#8217;ve only dabbled in the DH sound, like Kid606 and<br />Lesser (both of whom have graced my show in weeks previous).  All in all,<br />you\&#8217;ll get a taste of where this sound came from and a sense of the genres<br />it\&#8217;s consuming in its tireless, take-no-prisoners move forward.</p><br />
