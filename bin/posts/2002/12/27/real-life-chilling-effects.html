<h1>Real Life Chilling Effects</h1>
--- <br />- <p>My family went over to the palatial Virginia home of some of our friends,<br />an extensive clan headed by an old friend of my stepfather who happens to<br />run a large computer company.  After good food and a chance to play with a<br />stylish but otherwise astoundingly mediocre Compaq tablet PC, we got to<br />chatting.  One of the daughters in this family is going to school in<br />Scotland, and studying the biosciences.  When asked by my mother if she<br />intended to move abroad after school, she quickly confirmed this.  Not<br />only does she (understandably) like the people and atmosphere in the UK,<br />but <i>she&#8217;s interested in stem-cell research, which she probably won&#8217;t be<br />able to do here in the US</i>.<br /><br /><br />This just about ruined my evening right there.  Here&#8217;s an incredibly<br />smart, American born/raised/educated young woman interested in life saving<br />sciences that she <i>won&#8217;t be able to persue in our country</i>.  We&#8217;re<br />losing her, many of her student peers and their professional<br />superiors, the money and immediate medicinal benefits their research could<br />bring, and our positon as leaders in the world technology and medicine<br />markets.  And what for?<br/><br />The ethical insecurities of Congressmen, Senators, and lobbiests who call<br />themselves Christians while redirecting funds for social services and<br />public health to weapons and missile defense?  Our political leaders are<br />making our decisions clouded in a veil of technological <i>and</i> ethical<br />ignorance; they have demonstrated little understanding in<br />either realm.  But a decision that appeals to the self-appointed<br />&#8220;faithful&#8221; in this country can gather Bible Belt support in numbers large<br />enouth to sway a reelection vote.  Good Christian values have nothing to<br />do with it.<br /><br /><br />We&#8217;re losing this talented young woman, and countless like her.  We&#8217;re<br />just plain losing, as a nation previously concerned with progress.  These<br />are the <a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org/">Chilling Effects</a> of<br />technologically impaired<br />legislation, and winter is just beginning&#8230;</p><br />
