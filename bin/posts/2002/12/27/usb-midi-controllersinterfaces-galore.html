<h1>USB MIDI Controllers/Interfaces Galore + Max or Not to Max?</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>I mostly asked people to give to charities and good organizations this<br />year.  Lots of people gave to &lt;a<br />href=&#8221;http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org&#8221;&gt;Doctors Without Borders</a>, a<br />couple to <a href=\"http://www.wamu.org\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">WAMU</span></span></span></span></a>, one to the &lt;a<br />href=&#8221;http://www.aclu.org&#8221;&gt;ACLU</a>, and nobody<br />to the <a href=\"http://www.eff.org\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">EFF</span></span></span></span></a>.  Minus the last one, that<br />made me really happy.<br /><br /><br />But other than reading materials and a &lt;a<br />href=&#8221;http://www.thermos.com/products/products.cfm?grpID=30&amp;famID=4&amp;facID=1&#8221;&gt;badass<br />thermos</a>, my big selfish material gift was an &lt;a<br />href=&#8221;http://www.audiomidi.com/common/cfm/product.cfm?Product_ID=2510&#8221;&gt;Evolution<br />UC-16 <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">USB MIDI</span></span></span></span> controller</a>.  It&#8217;s swell: 16 assignable <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">MIDI</span></span></span></span> controller<br />knobs, perfect for just about any audio app, and totally <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">USB</span></span></span></span> bus-powered<br />(that means no wall wart power supply, yay!).  It&#8217;s a great solution, but<br />I still want a <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">USB</span></span></span></span> audio interface with a headphone out for DJing and<br />Ableton Live work.  Turns out M-Audio (formally Midiman) has a marriage of<br />the knobs with the inputs and outputs I want, with a keyboard in between:<br />the sucessor to the popular, small, and silver Oxygen, creatively titled<br />the <a href=\"http://www.m-audio.net/productst/midiman/ozone.php\">Ozone</a><br />does everything I&#8217;m looking for and then some, in<br />about the size of my iBook (the total package would be mad portable).  So<br />sorry Evolution, but I&#8217;m all about the Ozone (and yeah, the price is way<br />cheaper than what&#8217;s on the M-Audio site).<br />&lt;!<del><del>more</del></del>&gt;<br /><br /><br />I&#8217;m really digging the demo of the new &lt;a<br />href=&#8221;http://www.ableton.com&#8221;&gt;Ableton Live 2</a>.  Use of the program is<br />just so <i>natural</i>, and mucking about with samples is downright fun in<br />its elegant and powerful interface (sorry to sound like an advert, but<br />like <a href=\"http://www.emusic.com\">Emusic</a> it&#8217;s just one of those<br />products you want to tell everyone about).  The one area Live ignores (and<br />quite rightly, to keep things simple) is synthesis.  Through creative <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">VST</span></span></span></span><br />filtering you can do quite a bit to transform samples into almost wholey<br />new<br />sounds, but heavy sound generation and serious bitcrushing is still the<br />realm of other tools.  Were &lt;a<br />href=&#8221;http://www.native-instruments.com&#8221;&gt;Native Instruments</a> on the OS<br />X ball with Reaktor, I&#8217;d look to them for such software.  But for the<br />moment <a href=\"http://www.cycling74.com\">Cycling74&#8217;s</a> Max/MSP, the<br />original graphical programming/sound design environment, is the only such<br />professional tool that&#8217;s Mac <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">OS X</span></span></span></span> ready today (albeit in beta).  There&#8217;s<br />just one problem: Max/MSP has a practically vertical learning curve.  It&#8217;s<br />powerful software, but about as fluid and intuitive as soldering your own<br />synth together with hardware; not exactly an instant concept-to-product<br />workflow, like Live.  I&#8217;m curious if anyone out there knows of good<br />Max/MSP tutorials, and from there some good ambient/&lt;a<br />href=&#8221;http://www.microsound.org&#8221;&gt;microsound</a> instruments built with it.<br/><br />Whew!  Lots to learn, and such little time in the winter break&#8230;</p>"<br />
