<h1>Long Time No Update</h1>
--- <br />- "<p>I&#8217;m pretty certain that this blog has about as much readership as my radio<br />show has listenership: maybe two regulars, and the occasional unfortunate<br />stray.   To that end,<br />I feel no need to apologize for the length of time since my last update.<br/><br />And, if you must know, the past week&#8217;s radio show was a rather dodgy mix<br />of drum n&#8217; bass thrown together at the last minute.  It&#8217;s exam time here<br />at <span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\"><span class=\"caps\">UMBC</span></span></span></span>, and perhaps I&#8217;ll get back to updates after that&#8217;s all through.<br/><br />Perhaps not.</p>"<br />
