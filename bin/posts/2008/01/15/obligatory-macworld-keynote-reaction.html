<h1>Obligatory MacWorld Keynote Reaction, 2008 Edition</h1>
I'm excited about the <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/131581/2008/01/iphoneupdate.html">iPhone firmware update</a>.  Good features and fixes there.  Still waitin' on that SDK announcement.<br /><br />Don't care about <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/">Apple TV</a>, movie rentals, or any of the "Apple as media company" announcements.  Still not gonna pay for DRM-restricted content, nor build a home theater around it.<br /><br />Don't care about the <a href="http://www.apple.com/timecapsule/">Time Capsule</a> since I have a great NAS at home, although I wouldn't return it if I got one as a gift.  It would be nice if Apple allowed other network-attached storage devices to have more fine-grained control of how Time Machine backups consume disk space.<br /><br />If the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/">MacBook Air</a> was faster than my first-generation MacBook Pro and had better battery life, I'd order one today.  It doesn't, though, so now I'm stuck waiting for Apple to backport the Air's multi-touch trackpad and other enhancements to the MacBook Pro line.  The Air looks lovely -- perfect for business travelers -- but just not hardcore enough for my needs.   Well-positioned at the mid-point between the MacBook and MacBook Pro lines, then.<br /><br />All in all a fairly disappointing keynote for me personally, but hopefully one that moves a lot of units for Apple.  Even the prospect of more devices having multi-touch input is basically enough to satiate me this year.
