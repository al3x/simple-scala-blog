<h1>Work With Me Here</h1>
Since <a href="http://evhead.com/2008/01/startup-developers-telling-schmucks.asp">Ev mentioned it</a>, I'll mention it: Twitter is still <a href="http://twitter.com/help/jobs">hiring</a>.  We principally need engineers and operations people.  You don't have to know Ruby or Rails or any particular thing.  You mostly have to be smart, passionate, and nice. <br /><br />The biggest thing we're working on at Twitter right now is stability.  We know that we're incredibly lucky that our users put up with the site's frequent hiccups and outages.  Explaining what's behind those hiccups is complicated, but the point is that if you want to help turn Twitter into a world-class, rock-solid part of the web's infrastructure, now's the time to get on board.<br /><br />I'm not sure most people realize how small a company Twitter is.  We're four engineers, two operations guys, and eight others that comprise user support, product management, interaction design, and various keep-the-business running type things.  Similarly, we've been doing a lot more traffic than people think on way fewer servers than people think.  We're happy that we've been able to get by, but it's time to take it to the next level.  It's time to grow.<br /><br />If you're interested, I'm happy to answer any questions.  We've just hired a great VP of Engineering &amp; Operations who'd also like to talk to you; ask him about <em>writing the first version of QuickTime.  <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal;">Twitter is a great place to work, and the people are the best part.</span></em>
