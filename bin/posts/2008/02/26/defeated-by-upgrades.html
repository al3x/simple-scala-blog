<h1>Defeated By Upgrades</h1>
I've waited and waited and then waited some more for a new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a>.  I've not just been waiting for an upgrade but for a whole new machine, something as refreshingly different as the MacBook Air while retaining serious performance under the hood.<br /><br />My current MacBook Pro is two years old.  While it's worked well, the fact that it's not 64-bit has started to be an issue (ex: sharing virtual machines with coworkers).  So when Apple <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/132255/2008/02/macbookair.html">announced</a> upgraded (but not new) MacBook Pros today, I bit the bullet.  My new decked-out 15" MacBook Pro (with a glossy screen, after much debate on Twitter) should arrive next week. <br /><br />While I'm sure the new MacBook Pro will be superb, it's still a bit disappointing to wait for ages and still be purchasing a machine that's an incremental variation on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_G4#Titanium_PowerBook_G4">seven year old design</a>.  But then, if I cared more about design than performance, I would've gone for an Air.
