It's kind of a cool session, we think: Mike talks about consuming APIs from a developer/design perspective, and I talk about creating and maintaining APIs from a provider perspective.  There's going to be war stories and pretty graphs.  I'm excited.<br /><br />Funnily enough, there's a panel at SXSW called <a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels_schedule/?action=show&id=IAP060350">Building Developer-Friendly Web Service APIs</a> that's on the same tip.  With <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">APIs continuing to crop up left and right</a>, it's no surprise that people want to nosh on some best practices.  Michal and I intend to deliver, so join us in San Francisco!
