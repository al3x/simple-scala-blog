<h1>Treating Developers Right</h1>
I've had the idea for a quotation-capturing application for the Mac for some time. &nbsp;It's been towards the top of my list of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.al3x.net/2008/02/on-side-projects.html">side-projects</a>&nbsp;for ages, held in place by Cocoa's steep learning curve (easy to get started, takes years of experience to do an app right).<br /><br />It recently occurred to me that this application would work even better on the iPhone, and that the smaller "surface area" of the iPhone SDK might make the project more approachable. &nbsp;I applied to be an iPhone developer and began consuming Apple's materials for developers as I waited for approval.<br /><br />That was two weeks ago. &nbsp;In the intervening time, Apple has <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2008/10/01/iphone-nda-dropped/">disbanded the NDA</a> on the iPhone developer program, which indicates that they're responding to pressure from Android starting to materialize as a viable and open mobile development platform. &nbsp;It's disheartening that it takes a market threat in order for Apple to do the right thing by their developers.<br /><br />My full-time job is looking after Twitter's developer community. &nbsp;Twitter's and Apple's respective developer technologies are very different beasts, but it's hard to imagine treating our developers the way Apple treats theirs and still having a community to speak of.<br /><br />Let's be clear about Apple's iPhone developer program: you're paying them. &nbsp;That means they should work for you. &nbsp;If they don't, you should fire them. &nbsp;If Apple can't afford to support their developer community at $99 per year per developer, they should charge more. &nbsp;But in the two weeks that I've been <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">waiting for Apple to give me permission to pay them</span>, I've come to realize that my free time is better spent on side-projects that I have more control over.<br /><br />At Twitter, our developers don't pay us a dime, and we don't currently have a formalized quality of service policy that obliges us to any particular behavior. &nbsp;Still, leaving developers hanging without support for two weeks is unthinkable to me.<br /><br />Treating developers right isn't difficult: be open, be honest, and respect their time. &nbsp;When we've failed to keep to those rules, developers are rightly pissed. &nbsp;When we keep to them, our developers are happy. &nbsp;For the sake of my friends in the Mac development community, I hope Apple figures these simple rules out.
