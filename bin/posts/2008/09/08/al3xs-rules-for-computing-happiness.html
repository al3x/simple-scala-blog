<h1>al3x's Rules for Computing Happiness</h1>
A list.<br /><ol><h4>Software</h4><li>Use as little software as possible.</li><li>Use software that does one thing well.</li><li>Do not use software that does many things poorly.</li><li>Do not use software that must sync over the internet to function.</li><li>Do not use web applications that should be desktop applications.<br /></li><li>Do not use desktop applications that should be web applications.</li><li>Do not use software that isn't made specifically for your operating system. (You'll know it when you see it because it won't look right or work correctly.)</li><li>Do not run beta software unless you <a href="http://stevenf.com/archive/reporting-bugs-in-mac-os-x-apps.php">know how to submit a bug report</a> and are eager to do so.</li><li>Use a plain text editor that you know well. &nbsp;Not a word processor, a plain text editor.</li><li>Do not use your text editor for tasks other than editing text.</li><li>Use a <a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password">password manager</a>. You shouldn't know any of your passwords save the one to your primary email account and the one to your password manager.</li><li>Do not use software that's unmaintained.</li><li>Pay for software that's worth paying for, but only after evaluating it for no less than two weeks.</li><li>Thoroughly delete all traces of software that you no longer use.</li><h4>Hardware</h4><li>Do not buy a desktop computer unless your daily computing needs include video/audio editing, 3D rendering, or some other hugely processor-intensive computing task. &nbsp;Buy a portable computer instead.</li><li>Do not use your phone/smartphone/PDA/UMPC for tasks that would be more comfortably and effectively accomplished on a full-fledged&nbsp;computer. </li><li>Use a Mac for personal computing.</li><li>Use Linux or BSD on commodity hardware for server computing.</li><li>Do not use anything other than a Mac at home and Linux/BSD on the server.</li><li>The only peripheral you absolutely need is a hard disk or network drive to put backups on.</li><li>Buy as large an external display as you can afford if you'll be working on the computer for more than three hours at a time.</li><li>Use hosted services in lieu of hosting on your own hardware (or virtual hardware) for all but the most custom applications.</li><h4>File Formats</h4><li>Keep as much as possible in plain text. &nbsp;Not Word or Pages documents, plain text.</li><li>For tasks that plain text doesn't fit, store documents in an open standard file format if possible.</li><li>Do not buy digital media crippled by rights restriction technologies unless your intention is to rent the content for a limited period of time.</li></ol>These are my rules and they make me happy. &nbsp;I hope they make you happy too. &nbsp;If you have computing rules of your own that make you happy, I encourage you to publish them.
