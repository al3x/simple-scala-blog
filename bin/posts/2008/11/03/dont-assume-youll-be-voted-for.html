<h1>Don't Assume You'll Be Voted For</h1>
Today, I've seen a number of my pro-<a href="http://www.barackobama.com/">Obama</a> friends linking to statistics and reports that Obama has the election in the bag. &nbsp;This is dangerous and foolish. &nbsp;<a href="http://lessig.org/blog/2008/11/winning_tuesday_an_urgent_plea.html">Lawrence Lessig explains more</a>:<br /><blockquote>"We Democrats have trouble closing the deal. We have trouble continuing the push to the very last moment. We have repeatedly been blindsided by the fact that the other side votes regardless of the expected result, while we’re more contingent — making the effort if it seems necessary, relaxing when it doesn’t."</blockquote>Nobody is voting in your stead. &nbsp;Many people are voting against what you believe in. &nbsp;Get out and <a href="http://maps.google.com/vote">vote</a>. &nbsp;Do the right thing: vote for <a href="http://barackobama.com/">Barack Obama</a> and give America a chance at a brighter future.<br /><br />If you're in California,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.noonprop8.com/">Vote No on Prop 8</a>&nbsp;and encourage your friends, family, and coworkers to do the same. &nbsp;Stand up against hate, bigotry, and injustice.<br /><br />Once you've voted, share your experience at <a href="http://www.twittervotereport.com/">Twitter Vote Report</a>.  Your report could save time for other voters and help pinpoint voter fraud and problematic polling places.<br /><br /><a href="http://maps.google.com/vote">Vote</a>.
