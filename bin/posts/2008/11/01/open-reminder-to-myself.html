<h1>An Open Reminder To Myself</h1>
A journalist's output is journalism. &nbsp;A critic's output is criticism. &nbsp;A programmer's output should be programs.<br /><br />I am a programmer who writes. &nbsp;When I write, particularly when I write critically of technology, I should have programmatic solutions to offer along with my words. &nbsp;If I don't have code to back up what I have to say, I haven't thought through the problem at hand thoroughly enough.<br /><br />There's no shortage of questions, but answers are scarce.
