h1. More Long-Time-No-Updatage

I’m in the midst of a pleasant holiday, and I hope most of you are too. I’m out of town for eight
days starting tomorrow, perfecting my weapons satellites at an undisclosed location in the Southern
Hemisphere. On the off-hours, my reading consists of
"magic":http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0439434866/qid=1040938748/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/103-6494444-1160615,

I promise a more regular update schedule, and even some aesthetic improves, when I return. The lack
of a functioning version of open %(=caps)AFS% client Arla makes editing my blog a remote affair,
rather than the networked-but-same-as-local power of Arla/AFS. As you can imagine, that slows things
down a bit. Solutions will be, uhm, soluted and more in the New Year. I resolve as much. Cheers all.
