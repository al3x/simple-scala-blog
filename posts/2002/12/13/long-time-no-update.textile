h1. Long Time No Update

I'm pretty certain that this blog has about as much readership as my radio show has listenership:
maybe two regulars, and the occasional unfortunate stray. To that end, I feel no need to apologize
for the length of time since my last update. And, if you must know, the past week's radio show was a
rather dodgy mix of drum n' bass thrown together at the last minute. It's exam time here at
UMBC, and perhaps I'll get back to updates after that's all through. Perhaps not.
