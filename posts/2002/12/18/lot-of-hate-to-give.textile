h1. A Lot of Hate to Give

I am an angry young man when it comes to anything that ends up on the media radar. If he, she, or it
is in the papers and doing the talk show circuit, I probably have a few brain cells devoted to
despising them. And so, apparently, does the Buffalo Beast. Their "Most Loathsome People in
America, 2002":http://www.buffalobeast.com/article.php?path=2002/09/&amp;article=01_0 is dead on. I
can’t disagree with a single choice, their thoughts on these bastards, or their rankings. I even
found some new people to hate, and new reasons to hate people who already irked me. You’ll find
someone to hate too. Happy holidays.
