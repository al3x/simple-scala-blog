h1. Tonight’s Show: Industrial -> Digital Hardcore

This, like the noise show several weeks ago, is not a broadcast for the
weak of ear.  I’m starting with a couple later-day industrial tracks, the
groundwork for the sound extremity that follows chronologically.  From
there your eardrums are gonna get pounded by some of the luminaries of the
Digital Hardcore world, including DH label boss Alec Empire and his Atari
Teenage Riot project, Japanese DH-headbangers The Mad Capsule Markets, and
sound aggravators EC8OR.  Thrown in for good measure are some internet
unknowns and folks who’ve only dabbled in the DH sound, like Kid606 and
Lesser (both of whom have graced my show in weeks previous).  All in all,
you’ll get a taste of where this sound came from and a sense of the genres
it’s consuming in its tireless, take-no-prisoners move forward.
