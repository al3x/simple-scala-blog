h1. Innovative Interface Design

I’ve been used a pretty nondescript %(=caps)CPU% load monitor on my Mac %(=caps)OS X% system called "LoadInDock":http://homepage.mac.com/takashi_hamada/Acti/MacOSX/LoadInDock/, but it doesn’t provide a lot of info about my system for the amount of space it uses.  That’s why I was wowed by the Iconfactory’s "iPulse":http://www.iconfactory.com/ip_home.asp, an odd little nest of interlocking and concentric circles in varying colors that can tell you your %(=caps)CPU% load, memory and disk usage, network stats, and even the date and time, all either in your Dock or a floating window.  So in the same space that I got information about one aspect of my computer, I now get four.  That’s effective (and innovative) interface design.
