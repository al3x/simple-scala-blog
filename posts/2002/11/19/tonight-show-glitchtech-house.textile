h1. Tonight’s Show: Glitch/Tech-House (?)

Musical genres get harder to place every day, particularly in the ever-mutating realm of electronic music.  Anyone who’s been reading this blog is probably sick of me writing the word “genre” for just that reason: at a point, influences overlap to such a degree that trying to rope off a new catagory of music is unnecessary and inaccurate.  That’s why I’m not sure how to define the sound I’ve chosen for my show tonight.  It all, at some point or another, has a thumping four-on-the-floor house beat.  It all has traces of the glitchy, clicks-n-cuts sound of IDM.  Some might call it experimental house or techno, some tech-house, some minimal techno.  I’m not sure what it is, but I love this sound: intelligent, subtle, and yet backed by ass-shaking house beats.  Just listen, and enjoy (recommendation: turn the bass on your system *up*)."
