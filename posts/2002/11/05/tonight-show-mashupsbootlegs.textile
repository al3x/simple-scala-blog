h1. Tonight's Show: Mashups/Bootlegs

Well folks, it's been a blogless week, and for that I apologize.  But I've put together a damn entertaining show for this evening's regular broadcast on WMBC.  It's an hour of mashups, aka bootlegs (or "bootys" if you're really British).  Mashups are wonderful things: unlikely and illegally produced amalgamations of pop songs that add worth to otherwise dull radio fodder.  Check out a good "review":http://www.nuvo.net/news/archive/001130.html of a typical mashup compilation album, or have a gander at "Boom Selection":http://www.boomselection.net, the essential bootleg blog.  I've thrown in a fair variety for the evening's show, so listen, enjoy, and hope the FCC isn't listening too @^_^@
