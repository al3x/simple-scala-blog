h1. Wednesday Night at the 9:30

One of my first loves in the realm of electronica was "Ninjatune":http://www.ninjatune.com/, a largely downtempo record label without peer.  Their “Funkungfusion” compilation, which I picked up in a little record shop in Pasadena, changed my musical world.  With that in mind, I’m totally jazzed to see mad Brazilian glitch-loungehead Amon Tobin rock the "9:30":http://www.930.com club this Wednesday with DJ Food (actually a multi-DJ endevour given a face by two Englishmen) and Bonobo (who I’ve never heard, but has Ninjatune to rest his laurels on).  A full report will be offered.
