I don’t take for granted the fact that I have the safety, time, and privilege to be critical of our government; that says something good about America.  But there’s a time for critical parody, and the possibility of war with Iraq is certainly one of them.  So when the Man finds out you’ve been dissenting you can either "shut your face":http://homepage.mac.com/leperous/PhotoAlbum1.html or "move to Canada":http://bantha.cjb.net/stuffins/john/switch.php.  It’s nice to have options.
