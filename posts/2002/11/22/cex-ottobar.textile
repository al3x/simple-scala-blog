h1. Cex @ The Ottobar

Last night I got to see "Tigerbeat6":http://www.tigerbeat6.com recording artist "Cex":http://www.rjyan.com/ play at the "Ottobar":http://www.theottobar.com in his hometown of Baltimore.  Having been to many the show in my brief days, I can safely say this was the most singular performance I’ve yet seen.  Cex gets intimate with the audience; so intimate, in fact, that he’s talking with the audience about how intimate he gets with them without the whole affair dripping in irony and production.  Unlike his largely instrumental electronic discography, a Cex show is essentially a hip-hop affair: he talks for a few minutes, then plays his own pre-recorded beats from an iBook and raps along.  His rhymes are amusing and his music is decent, but the really enjoyable parts of his performance are the self-analytical impromptu conversations with the audience.  I encourage you to seek first a live Cex show, then perhaps look up his catalog if you like either whiteboy hip-hop or melodic %(=caps)IDM% _ala_ Warp Records.  The Cex mystique really can’t be explained – you need a demonstration.
