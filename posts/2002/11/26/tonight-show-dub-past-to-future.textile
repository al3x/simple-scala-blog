h1. Tonight’s Show: Dub, Past to Future

As I mentioned in my electroclash rant, the odd spacey-bassy Jamaican
musical style known as dub is making a comeback, and I couldn’t be
happier.  Dub was an outgrowth of reggae made possible by the
reverb-on-steroids “delay” effect originally intended for guitars and
the genius of producers like King Tubby, Lee “Scratch” Perry, and The
Scientist.  Dub takes reggae, slows the already ganja-drenched sound
down, turns up the bass, and sends the whole thing through Zion’s own echo
chamber.  The result is beautiful, otherworldly, and has influenced the
development of music in both drastic and subtle ways, particularly in the
realm of electronic music.  Selected for your listening pleasure are some
of the classics of the dub genre and the future sounds they’ve spawned.
This is another show that calls for big bass and serious relaxation.
