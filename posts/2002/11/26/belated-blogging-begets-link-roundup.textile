h1. Belated Blogging Begets Link Roundup

Well, I’ve been busy with studies and absent from the blogosphere, so my apologies. But the fact is,
I’m still busy and that means you’re spared from one of the lengthy sermons that typically accompany
my links. So here are a bevy of interesting things on the Interweb to keep you thinking:

* "Microsoft says %(=caps)DRM% is “pointless”":http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2502399.stm
* "Lawrence Lessig talks in various formats":http://randomfoo.net/oscon/2002/lessig/
* "John Bloom on copyrights":http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-bloom112202.asp
* "John Gillmore sues the government to travel the skies without identifying himself":http://cryptome.org/freetotravel.htm.

There. Enjoy.
