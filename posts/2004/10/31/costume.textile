h1. Costume

My Halloween costume this year was "zombie Reagan":http://www.bush-zombiereagan.com/, perhaps better described: Frankenreagan, given that I applied faux bolts to my neck.  I wore a standard Reagan mask, the aforementioned bolts masked with a touch of greenish makeup on my neck, a black suit with a white dress shirt, and a red-with-blue-stripes-and-ducks old man tie from a thrift store down the street, and an authentic vintage “Your Next President: Ronald Reagan” pin from a political memorabilia shop in downtown DC.  Political costumes are never the hit of the party, but people were amused once they had taken in the details.

Pictures exist, but I will not go out of my way to procure even digital copies.  I didn’t wear the mask hardly at all, so there’s not much to see.  Enjoy the festivities this weekend; it’s a good Halloween weekend that lets you carouse under a blood moon.
