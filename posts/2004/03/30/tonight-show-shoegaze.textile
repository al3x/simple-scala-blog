h1. Tonight’s Show: Shoegaze
I’m still working on the playlist, but tonight’s Selection 3 will bring you an hour of shoegaze/dreampop and related rock sounds.  The genre gets its name from the practice of some of its foremost musicians of gazing at their shoes while they create endless waves of echoing guitar feedback.  Well-known shoegaze acts include My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, and Flying Saucer Attack.  The style saw its peak in early 1990s.
