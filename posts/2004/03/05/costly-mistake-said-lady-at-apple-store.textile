h1. A Costly Mistake, Said The Lady At The Apple Store
No shit, bitch.
I went and left my iBook’s power adaptor at home for the first time ever.  _Ever_.  I must be stressed, because this is the second time in as many days that I’ve left something at home (yesterday it was my keys).  I just don’t do that sort of thing.
My descending premature Alzheimer’s aside, why the devil are Apple power adaptors US$80.00?!  I understand they’re compact and well-designed, but do they really cost that much to build?  It’s not like it’s a captive market for Apple; there are plenty of third-party power adaptors out there.  Puzzling.
