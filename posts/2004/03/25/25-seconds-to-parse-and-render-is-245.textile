h1. 25 Seconds To Parse and Render Is 24.5 Seconds Too Long
My kingdom for a fast %(=caps)XML% parser (for %(=caps)PHP%, specifically).  These "benchmarks":http://php.weblogs.com/discuss/msgReader$3290 are appalling, and they’re better than what I’m getting on some internal projects.  And no, the new libxml2-based SimpleXML extension in %(=caps)PHP5% isn’t exactly a speed demon either.  It’s not %(=caps)PHP%’s fault, it’s %(=caps)XML%’s.  “Human readable” doesn’t really entail “performance.”  
Also, I’m the first person to notice this about %(=caps)XML%.  Ever.
