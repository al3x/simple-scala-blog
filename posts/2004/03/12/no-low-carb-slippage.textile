h1. No Low-Carb Slippage!

I tried letting the Atkins slip a bit, indulging in an occasional tortilla or even (gasp!) sandwich, and it hasn't turned out well.  I haven't put on any weight as a result, but any gradual "Phase 3" weight loss I had going has stopped.  On days I ate more carbs I noticed a loss of focus and a significant drop in energy levels, and I generally just felt gross.  A sandwich sure is more convenient than an Atkins lunch, but it's not worth it.

I've been considering looking into the less-restrictive South Beach diet.  One way or another I seem to need a low-carb regimen to stay slim and keep my blood sugar level, but I can't help but worry about the fat-centric aspects of Atkins.  My impression is that South Beach is a "healthier" diet (in the low fat sense that we've all been taught) that still kicks out bad carbs.

"Jon":http://iheartmena.typepad.com/ has just set up a blog/community site for all things low-carb over at "Carbwire":http://www.carbwire.com/, which is diet agnostic in favoring neither Atkins nor South Beach and generally nifty.  Resources like that are helping me stick with the "low-carb lifestyle," which I maintain as being worthwhile if you're one of us unfortunates with slug-speed metabolisms.
