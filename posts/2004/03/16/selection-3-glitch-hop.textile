h1. Selection 3: Glitch-Hop
Tonight’s show brings you hip-hop run through bit-mashers and rhythm-skitterers; Timbaland and the Neptunes on acid.  You’ll know why when you hit Machine Drum’s “Jigga Why?,” but your head will have long since engaged in perma-nod.  Lots of "Warp":http://www.warprecords.com/ and "Merck":http://www.m3rck.net/, some fresh drops and some throwbacks.  Comin’atcha from iTunes in all likelihood (I got 99 problems and a glitch is one).  Situate your streaming %(=caps)MP3% client of choice at "%(=caps)WMBC%":http://wmbc.umbc.edu/, 8 – 9PM %(=caps)EST%.
