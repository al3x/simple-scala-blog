h1. That’s Good IRC

"Colloquy":http://www.javelin.cc/colloquy/index.html is such an unfathomably good %(=caps)IRC% client it’s … unfathomable.  I cannot fathom it.  Presently not fathoming.  So forth.
It’s for %(=caps)OS X% and acts like it all proper.  It makes %(=caps)IRC% pretty so you can ignore the inane conversations.  It is good and free and open and righteous.
