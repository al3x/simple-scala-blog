h1. Investment Strategy
I’d like to start getting into investing in a big way.  I’m mostly interested in buying some solid, moderate-return mutuals for starters before I get into riskier ventures.  I’m doing my Google homework, but any readers have financial web sites or resources they find essential?  Any investing blogs, that sort of thing?  Thanks kids.
