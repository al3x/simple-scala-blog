h1. But BBC1, I Thought You Loved Me!

It's nothing new, but the streaming "dance shows available on the BBC1":http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/dance/ bring a little bit of joy into my life.  I know Brits seem to think of the BBC as too commercial, and the dance music they play as sell-out crap, but here across the pond the very idea that a real radio station would really play electronic dance music for real is unfathomably great.  The famous BBC1 shows like Pete Tong's Essential Selection, Judge Jules' show, and a host of others all offer top-notch dance fair, fun and new and enthusiastically hosted.  Some of the odd-hours shows like "The Breezeblock":http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/dance/breezeblock/tracklistings.shtml?focuswin have more eclectic fair, such as this week's showcase of "Ghostly International":http://ghostlyinternational.com/ artists.  Plus, they can swear on their radio.

But with the Breezeblock in my headphones, I'm amazed that anyone on the style-whorin' British Isles is still buying into retro-'80s crap like 'Muscle Car' by Mylo, yet another insipidly electrosexual throwaway track.  Thankfully, selections like that are few and far between on the superb BBC1 dance shows.  Don't pass up "Bobby Friction + Nihal":http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/urban/bobbyandnihal/'s bangin' Asian beats show; I sweat that desi-hop shit.
