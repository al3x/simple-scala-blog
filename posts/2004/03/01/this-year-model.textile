h1. This Year’s Model
The Gentoo crew just "got their release on":http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng/ with Gentoo 2004.0 (_nice_ versioning schema: year first, counting up the quarters from zero like true geeks).  With ports for x86, %(=caps)AMD64%, PowerPC, %(=caps)SPARC%, and %(=caps)MIPS% there’s no excuse for not trying it if you’re unhappy with your present Linux distro or other OS.  I’d be installing this _right now_ if I had a spare machine.  I may go find a computer in my school’s library and install it on that while nobody’s looking.  Gentoo is just that hot.
Link from "OSNews":http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=6206, which took a break from posting twelve embarrassingly-written defenses of Linux on the desktop per day to actually bring us some OS news.
