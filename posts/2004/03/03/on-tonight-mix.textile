h1. On Tonight’s Mix

I had a blast doing tonight’s mix, but if you were tuned in you probably heard me cursing my software more than enjoying myself.  Live gave me a few fits and starts, mostly in the warp marker department.  I hadn’t mapped out a couple of tracks as well as I had thought and they started pitching all over the place, like a toddler playing with the speed control on a record player.  I had to make a couple of quick exits due to those warping issues, and a couple of times I just mis-clicked.  Still, for not having any cueing capabilities nor even a MIDI crossfader there were some pretty smooth transitions in there.  I’m really excited about what I’ll be able to do with hardware assistance and more practice.

But as for the small matter of the recording of the set: obviously I’m not putting a botched mix out there for y’all.  I’m gonna clean it up, even switch out a couple of the tracks (Pole’s “Slow Motion (Instrumental)” at the beginning is a nice track, but jumping from 77 to 122 BPM just doesn’t jive), and then I’ll post the new mix for your listening pleasure.

Thanks again to those of you who tuned in!
