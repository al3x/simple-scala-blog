h1. Festivals!
I won’t write too much because neither site has a proper lineup listed, but both Baltimore’s local "Once.Twice":http://www.oncetwicesound.com/html/htmlenter.html festival of experimental electronic music and the world-renowned "Mutek":http://www.mutek.ca/index-en.html festival in Montreal are coming in the next few months, and I intend to be at both of them.  
I went to a couple of last year’s Once.Twice events and they were great fun, and this year promises the likes of Akufen, Dabrye, %(=caps)AGF%, and other glitchy notables.  I want to attend all three days of performances this year.
Mutek’s 2004 lineup is still something of a mystery, but rumor has it that Richie Hawtin will be there in his Plastikman guise.  I’m not particularly plussed about his most recent _Closer_, nor did I find his DJ performance to be the spiritual, transcendent experience it’s been billed as, but it’s always interesting to see what notables are doing.  Mutek has a great reputation, and its host city of Montreal an even better one, so I’m really looking forward to this, pretty much my first real vacation in well over a year.
More thoughts when final lineups are posted.  And don’t even talk to me about Coachella or the %(=caps)WMC%.  Yes, I know who’s there, all of them.  No I can’t go.  Yes, I desperately want to.  _Le sigh_.
