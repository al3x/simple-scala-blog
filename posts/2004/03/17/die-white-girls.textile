No, I'm not still going on about _Generation S.L.U.T._, it's just one of the more memorable lyrics from "Coheed &amp; Cambria":http://www.coheedandcambria.com/'s new-to-me _In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3_.  I've fallen in love with this album as quickly and in the same fashion as its predecessor, the superb _The Second Stage Turbine Blade_.  Both albums suck you in on the first listen with little hooks you have to go back and hear again, and pretty soon you realize the whole album is as good as those hooks and you won't haven't listened to a damn thing else for days.  

And why would you?  It's hard not to adore a band that can make lyrics like "pull the trigger and the nightmare stops" into future sci-fi power ballad singalongs.

I'm psyched that Co&amp;Ca are finding their way to DC in April, but it's much to my dismay that they're playing the show with Ranier Maria, who I despise as the epitome of everything wrong with emo.  I need to find out just when the set times are so I can get in and out of the ol' "9:30 club":http://www.930.com/ without suffering any whiny bullshit in the interest of seeing my beloved Co&amp;Ca.
