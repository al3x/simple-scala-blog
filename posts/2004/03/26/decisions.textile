h1. Decisions
You don’t have to read my agonizing over school vs. work anymore, because I’m not agonizing over it anymore.
This evening, sooner than I thought I would, I talked things through with my parents.  I’d decided I was taking a year leave from my university at the end of this semester one way or another, but ideally with their blessing.  I got that blessing and, what’s more, their support and enthusiasm, limited only by good longview parental concerns about my job market viability should I not finish school.  It’s a risk, and that much was acknowledged on both our parts, but equally understood is the potential for my success in both a business and personal sense.  They understand the pressure I wrote about a couple days ago and know just how much I enjoy the work that I’m doing.  They’ve got confidence in me, and were happy with the way in which I broached the the subject.  In short, everyone’s happy.  Especially my boss.
So once this semester ends, I’ll be back in Bethesda for several weeks until Phil and I move into whichever of the plentiful 2-bedroom apartments in downtown DC we decide on.  I’ll be working full time, and thrilled to be doing so.  And you guys won’t have to suffer any more what-ifs and related whining, nor will I.  It’s time to just do it.  As my stepfather, a man who knows, said this evening, “opportunities don’t hang around long.”
I’m pretty damn happy right now.  And I’m gonna go see Broken Social Scene.
