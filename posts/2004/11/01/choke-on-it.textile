h1. Choke On It

My favorite drink of late is a Choker: "Pernod":http://www.pernod-ricardusa.com/brands/anise/brand_pernod.html, scotch, and bitters shaken and served over ice.  The drink has a milky yellow color, the usual anise nose of Pernod, and it leaves the tongue pleasantly numb after a few sips.  One Choker is enough to allow your companions to work through a couple beers, martinis, or coffees.  Alternatively, if you're drinking alone (as I increasingly am for lack of friends in the city) one Choker is enough to get through several chapters of a novel or a newspaper read front-to-back.

I order Chokers, albeit not by name, at "Tryst":http://www.trystdc.com, where they feature Pernod on their weekend cocktail menu and pour a generous glass for $7.00.
