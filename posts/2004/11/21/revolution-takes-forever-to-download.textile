h1. The Revolution Takes Forever To Download

I'll acknowledge the BitTorrent revolution that is purportedly reshaping the very nature of media consumption when this goddamn episode of The Simpsons downloads.  Which, despite there purportedly being _thousands_ of people in a vast self-selecting hive mind of media-reshaping and minor, glib piracy eager to share said episode with me, the revolution is going to take a good six to thirteen hours more according to my BitTorrent client.

Chagrined.
