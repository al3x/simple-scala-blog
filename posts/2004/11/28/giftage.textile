I’ve been on the Interweb for A Long Goddamn Time, relatively speaking.  Wishlists have been around for not so much of that Long Goddamn Time, but long enough that you’d think I would’ve used them at some point.  Not the case.

Yesterday "Warren":http://www.diepunyhumans.com/ linked to "The Doctor Pepper Show":http://doctorpepper.keenspace.com/, which instantly floored me.  It’s drawn by a teenage anime geek girl, the kind you’d expect to have an "LJ":http://www.livejournal.com, and "does":http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=pepper_maid, and by extension the kind you’d expect to have an Amazon wishlist, but didn’t.

So I emailed her.  I said “I’ve never ever been moved to give someone a random something for making good content, but your content makes me want to do this thing.”  And she made "a wishlist":http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/27YEM4OU2SZRE/104-6634387-7885558?.  And I bought her "this book I have and enjoy and can vouch for":http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1856693910/qid=1101681062/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-5179732-3537757?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846.  It was a simple, satisfying social transaction.

Her comic is brilliant.  It does things with the comic book/manga format I’ve never seen, and some things I had seen but not seen enough of.  It’s messed up in the best way.  It makes me eyes happy.  It brought me to patronage.  That is what good content does.
