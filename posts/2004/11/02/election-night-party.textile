h1. Election Night Party

I will be at the "ReDefeat Bush":http://redefeatbush.com/index.php party on Election night, a sullen independent in a sea of enthused and expectant liberals.  I’ll be the one wearing the Kerry-Edwards pin.  Ha-ha.

If you’re a US citizen of voting age: vote.  Then come drink.  Preferably in that order.
