h1. Questionable Sartorial Decisions #1

Somebody talk me down from ordering a "Neighborhoodie":http://www.neighborhoodies.com with "DIE WHITE GIRLS":http://plyrics.com/lyrics/coheedandcambria/theveloriumcamperiiialthekiller.html on it.  Pink text.  Maybe a heart on it, somewhere.

(It was a joke, Brittany.)

For the life of me I can't think of what to put on a sweatshirt.
