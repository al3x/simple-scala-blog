h1. Get Out Of My Head – Or Better Yet, Don’t
--- 
- "p. "Junior Boys":http://www.electrokin.com/artists/junior_boys/ make the music I’ve been hearing and writing in my head.  Only, you know, better – and here now for the listening, if a little more retro-electro than I’d go.  But the singer has got a voice that reminds me of the sound of my voice when recorded, and the whole thing has the kind of simple songwriting, quiet and retrained production, and wavering romantic vocals that I’d be going for.  I kind of feel beat to the punch, but mostly happy that somebody else out there is making a variation of the music I hear in my head and it’s really good: the shimmery softness of good downtempo, hints of New Wave in the synths and vocals, faint %(=caps)IDM% glitches and erratic rhythms, nods to sparse click-house, and a generally masterful use of sonic space.  Oh yeah, and they got Fennesz to do a remix.  I’m not gonna get Fennesz.  But they did.
You should go listen to these cats.  I’ll still share what I end up making with you, of course, but these guys…  wow."
