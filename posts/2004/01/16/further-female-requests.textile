- p. Awhile back I "wished":http://www.al3x.net/mt/archives/000309.html for a girl who would listen to the "Deftones":http://www.deftonesworld.com/ with me (or I guess, more accurately, get frisky to the Deftones with me because I find their music for some indiscernible reason as mood-setting as "/B0000047CX/104-1195666-9110311?v=glance”&gt;Getz/Gilberto": or anything "Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister":http://www.g-stoned.com/).
That wish stands, but my addendum today is that it’d be swell if I could play "Dizzee Rascal":http://www.dizzeerascal.co.uk/’s "“I Luv You”":http://search.able2know.com/About/1122.html to her in total jest before putting on excellent sexy soft slow between-the-sheets %(=caps)IDM% album _"/B00005QHR8/qid=1074219173/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-1195666-9110311?v=glance&amp;s=music”&gt;Life Is Full of Possibilities":_ by "Dntel":http://www.discogs.com/artist/Dntel, particularly tracks “Why I’m So Unhappy” and "“(This Is) The Dream Of Evan And Chan”":http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/SongUnid/D1B86046664B1B8D48256D6B0028156C.
Oh shit, did I just jinx chances of any of this ever occurring by blogging it?  Rats.  Oh well, at least I still have you, iTunes playlists…
