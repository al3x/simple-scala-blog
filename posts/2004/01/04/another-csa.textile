h1. Another CSA

- "p. Several of the InfoSec guys (read: 31337 hax0rz) I was hanging out with on Friday run nifty Cool Shit Aggregator ("%(=caps)CSA%":http://www.al3x.net/mt/archives/000255.html) called "Pants Factory":http://www.pantsfactory.org/.  It’s got a definite security bent to it, but there’s some cool and funny stuff there too.  Look, but don’t touch: this is mostly by the authors and for the authors, and having run a little community site like that I can safely say that they _don’t_ want your three week stale "Fark":http://www.fark.com/ links.  Jerkass."
