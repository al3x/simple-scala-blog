h1. Deep Thinking, Deep Bass

Simon Reynolds "riffs":http://blissout.blogspot.com/2004_01_04_blissout_archive.html#107353834054392035 on Tim Finney’s "thoughts":http://skykicking.tripod.com/2003_12_01_archive.html#107189075093233638 on “rhythmic danger” in jungle/drum ‘n bass with such elegant language and historical accuracy that I wouldn’t dare offer my own addendum.  It’s reassuring that a) there are bigger genrewhores out there in electronic music fandom than me; b) there are people who love this music so much as to think such deep and multifaceted thoughts about it; c) the brief and intense history of this music is being documented in a personal fashion.  Essential reading.
