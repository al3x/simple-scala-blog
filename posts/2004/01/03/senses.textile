# The cartoon character pitched-up sound of a diva wailing “you abandoned me” in a mix of old ‘ardkore techno pumping out my iPod -&gt; car stereo.
# The familiar sights of the drive to Pentagon City Mall, the mall itself, and old 2600 friends and acquaintances.
# The taste of cheerily advertised low-carb chicken processed fake sauce strips at a chain restaurant.
# The smell of Middle Eastern cafe Oasis: falafel buried under cigarettes and hookah smoke.
# The airy, just-thick-enough-like-good-custard taste and smell of banana shisha, and the disappointingly saccharine taste of coconut shisha.
# The sight of a cheap remake of a classic wooden table filled with the multicolored, tri-sized plastic pyramids that form the structures of a Zendo game.
# The sound of good conversation, and ridiculous conversation, and sometimes both.
# The feeling of cold real air and hot fake air colliding.
