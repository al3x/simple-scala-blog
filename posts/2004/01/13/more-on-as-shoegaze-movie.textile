h1. More on “Lost” As Shoegaze Movie

In my "top 3 of 2K3":http://www.al3x.net/mt/archives/000437.html film selection a couple days ago I argued, based on director Sophia Coppola’s choice to tap shoegaze virtuoso Kevin Shields for several soundtrack pieces and based on certain visual elements that fit the aesthetic, that _Lost in Translation_ is a shoegaze film if ever there was one.  "As it turns out":http://www.emperornorton.com/mod/artistpage.php3?artist=lost_in_translation, the music supervisor for the film had made a three CD mix of “very atmospheric, ambient stuff” he tellingly entitled _Tokyo Dream Pop_ (“dream pop” or “bliss pop” being synonymous with the term “shoegaze”).  Pulling Shields into the project just came naturally from there, apparently.
