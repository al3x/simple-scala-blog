h1. In The Tribe Again

I’m back on "Tribe.net":http://www.tribe.net/.  I missed the Family Guy tribe discussions and a couple of the others.  If you were in my circle of friends on Tribe please don’t hesitate to add yourself again.

Hypocritical for criticizing Tribe, leaving, and then coming back?  I guess.  Its interface has improved a touch, at least.  Whatever.  It’s still better than Friendster.
