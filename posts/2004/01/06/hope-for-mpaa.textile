h1. Hope for the MPAA?

There’s hope for this movie industry political behemoth if they heed Chris Anderson, editor of Wired magazine, and his "Memo to the New Head of the %(=caps)MPAA%":http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.01/mpaa_pr.html.  The copyfight may be old news, but it’s not nearly over.  These suggestions could turn around the %(=caps)MPAA%’s public image – and their business.  Good stuff, and thankfully beholden to classic Wired values.
