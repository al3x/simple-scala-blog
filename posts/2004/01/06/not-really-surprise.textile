h1. Not Really A Surprise
--- 
- p. I think it’s funny, but not particularly surprising, that "absolut/freqnasty/pages/1365%20Stuntrock%20and%20Doormouse.htm”&gt;these guys": are two of the hardest motherfuckers making breakcore/digital hardcore/really goddamn noisy beats today.  Seriously, every time I think I’m satisfied with listening to slick-ass tech/micro-house I put on some Stuntrock and remember what evil sounds like (a woman’s scream, endlessly looped, over positively decimated jungle beats).  And yes, evil sounds good.
Punk is long since dead and these guys (along with their breakcore peers like Venetian Snares) are fucking its exhumed corpse.  And recording what that sounds like through a bunch of distortion for their next albums, probably.  They don’t need to be done up in $80 pre-ripped-and-safetypinned bondage pants and $25 reprints of Dead Kennedys t-shirts to be harder than your one creepy grabby uncle on Viagra.
