h1. Grime? Stripped Garage?

I don’t know quite what to call it, but the post-Garage sound of Skream has had my head nodding since I caught his January mix off "Grievous Angel":http://grievousangelsoundsystem.blogspot.com/2004_02_01_grievousangelsoundsystem_archive.html#107598651193441888 the other day.  It does, as per a comment in that link, sound like early Autechre, just with the rhythmic influence coming from Garage rather than Hip-Hop and Acid House.  I went looking for more, and came across an "interview":http://www.hyperdub.com/softwar/plastic.cfm with a cat called Plasticman (not Richie “Plastikman with a goddamn K” Hawtin) who’s deep in the scene of UK kids making this stripped-down, dark Garage.  Check it.
