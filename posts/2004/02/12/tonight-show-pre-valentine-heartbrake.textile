h1. Tonight’s Show: Pre-Valentine’s Heartbrake Songs

What a way to start a new semester of radio shows.

Normally I’d be doing shows both Tuesday and Thursday, but this week is a little funny.  Tuesdays I reserve for genre explorations and more “themed” shows, and Thursdays I’m just playing whatever the hell I want.  I feel like playing songs for anyone nursing a broken heart this Valentine’s Day, so that’s what I’m gonna do.  You can tune in from 6-7PM %(=caps)EST% on "%(=caps)WMBC%":http://wmbc.umbc.edu, whose %(=caps)MP3% streams should work more than not.
