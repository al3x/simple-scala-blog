If I could meet a fly honey on this godforsaken campus you’d know I’d give that ho a "Shit Bitch Bear":http://www.tomatoalligator.com/.  Mack squarely laid down.
Props to "PHiZ":http://thoughtcriminal.com/ for the link.
And, for the record, I mean _meet_.  Not as in, “successfully ask out on a date,” implying failures of that nature, of which there have been none.  None because I haven’t met any dateable females.  This is what I get for picking the techie state campus.
Whatever.  Whine whine whine.  That bear is money.
