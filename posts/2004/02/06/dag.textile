I could give the better part of a fuck about not being at "ETCon":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etcon/, but damned if I’m not bummed about missing another great "party":http://www.commonhouse.net/wiki/em3rg1ngl0ft/FrontPage at "Dachb0den Labs":http://www.dachb0den.com/.
I guess I should qualify that first statement.  There are some neat people who’ll be at ETCon, and certainly the "Digital Democracy Teach-In":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/et2004/edemo.csp is pertinent to my interests and work.  But any event that has teach-ins is _bad news_, in my limited experience.  The whole vibe is a little too Left Coast cyberdelic for me to stomach (see Don Box of Microsoft’s "“Peace, Love, and %(=caps)XML%”":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2004/view/e_sess/4913 talk Wednesday; and _that’s_ in the clearly-tacked-on-because-oh-shit-the-DotCom-bubble-burst-justify-this-BS-quick "“Products &amp; Services”":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/28/track_products.html track).
Or let’s put it this way: if I’m not taking my pasty, sun-starved, East Coast ass all the way out west for "DefCon":http://www.defcon.org/, where the drugs are most certainly better, what makes you think I’m shelling out to O’Reilly?
