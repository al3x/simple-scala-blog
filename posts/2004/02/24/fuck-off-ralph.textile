h1. Fuck Off, Ralph
As a registered independent not willing to relinquish that status for a vote in the Maryland primary, you’d think I’d be pro-Nader just on the merit of having an independent in the race.  Nope.  Nuh-uh.  
Most commentaries are saying, “there’s a time for ideology, and there’s a time for political reality.”  I think those two are one in the same in this case.  If Nader gave a shit about anybody but himself he wouldn’t have so much as donned a unbleached cotton sweatband for this race.  “Anybody But Bush” isn’t just a slogan; for the next nine months, it’s a goddamn _mantra_.  
And you’d think those hippy-ass Greens would be down with mantras.
