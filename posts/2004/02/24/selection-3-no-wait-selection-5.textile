h1. Selection 3: No, Wait, Selection 5!

Tomorrow night’s Selection 3 will be selected and hosted by none other than 5dots, who has a playlist I’ve not yet seen at "his site":http://www.5dots.net/news/archives/000030.html.

This is interesting for a couple reasons.  First, I have no idea what he’s playing, just a CD of tracks I’m told is an hour long and appropriate for radio.  I’ve also been told it’s not “The Gambler” seven or eight times over, but I could have been lied to.  The second reason you should tune in is that 5dots won’t actually be in the WMBC studios.  He’s hosting the entire thing from Virginia, literally “phoning it in,” probably via iChat.

So if you’re sick of my shit, tune in tomorrow from 8-9PM on "WMBC":http://wmbc.umbc.edu.
