h1. Please Ignore The Previous Post

...well, if you don’t already know or care about my basic personal details.  But that previous post will henceforth serve as my “about’ page, and will be updated as necessary.  If there’s anything you’d like to know about me that you think should be on there, don’t hesitate to let me know.  Most of that, and more, is available to anyone on Orkut, so I figured I might as well put it up here.  I don’t like little lists of personal keywords, but I _really_ don’t like cutesy, self-effacing, oh-so-clever mini-autobiographies.  So that’s what random visitors get to read about me.

In other site news, I’ve been fiddling with little details here and there, but the new design and backend is pretty much all settled in.  I’ve also implemented "Refer":textism.com/tools/refer/, having been inspired by "this smart post":http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2004/02/17/referral_rant.html by Rands on information as the currency and lifeblood of weblogging.
