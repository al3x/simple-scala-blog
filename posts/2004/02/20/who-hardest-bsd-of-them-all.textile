h1. Who’s The Hardest BSD of Them All?

The mi2g Intelligence Unit, their goofy name previously unbeknownst to me, has "dubbed Mac OS X the “world’s safest operating system”":http://www.mi2g.net/cgi/mi2g/frameset.php?pageid=http%3A//www.mi2g.net/cgi/mi2g/press/190204_2.php, while getting in a few jabs at Linux’s security track record.

Meanwhile, OpenBSD seems to be "paying more attention to niggling license details":http://www.deadly.org/article.php3?sid=20040220085910 than security or performance, both of which have recently been called into question.  I know I wouldn’t really think of running OpenBSD as a production server these days, save maybe as a firewall or IDS box.  Given that I used to host this domain on an OpenBSD not three years ago, that’s kinda sad.
