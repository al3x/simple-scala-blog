h1. SG Misdeeds?

"Ed":http://www.funkatron.com/ points out "some evidence":http://www.livejournal.com/community/sgirls/62020.html of murmurings I had heard about SG models not being well-treated (that is, not paid well or in a timely fashion, not abused during photoshoots or something ghastly like that).  Shoot, guess it’s not guilt-free after all.  At least SG seems to have inspired a host of sites in the same vein who, according to the thread linked above, treat their models better while maintaining a pro-girl attitude and indie style.  "ManicJane":http://manicjane.com/, raver-friendly "Erotic %(=caps)BPM%":http://www.eroticbpm.com/, and "Fatal Beauty":http://fatalbeauty.com/ all seem to be popular alternatives to SG’s, well, alternative.

*Update:* Ed is apparently a big fan of what is apparently called “altporn,” and as such is starting a "directory of altporn sites":http://altporn.funkatron.com/directory/ to compliment his languishing "altporn blog":http://altporn.funkatron.com.  Who says blogs can’t connect like-minded individuals to promote positive social works? ^_^
