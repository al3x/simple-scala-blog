h1. Beats Like Venomous Acid-Blood Burning Though A Space Station’s Metal Floor

If you’ve got any love for DJ /rupture, Kid606, Broklyn Beats, or any of the other raggabreakcore playas, grab the mix linked up "right here":http://66.227.18.130/ripley.html ASAP.  Like, you should have done it yesterday, and kept it on loop since then.  As if being a lady DJ whose namesake is the bad ass sister from _Alien_ isn’t enough, soundgirl Ripley goes dropping and cutting up shit you wouldn’t even think. <3.
