h1. Singing

It's not like if I had decided to make those songs I would have been singing them for a crowd regularly, but it makes me consider how I'm going to get my singing fix.  I love to sing, mostly along with whatever I'm listening to.  I'm not even sure the songs I wrote were all that much fun for me to sing.

I never felt, when in relationships, the need to sing for an anybody but the girl I was with.  It's the perfect metaphor for the way I feel most days: not so much missing being in love with a particular person as just being in love at all, with all its wonderful trappings.

It would be nice to have somebody to sing for again.  Until then I'm happy making odd harmonies with "Broken Social Scene":http://www.arts-crafts.ca/bss/'s ""Anthems For a Seventeen Year-Old Girl."":http://www.geocities.com/glimpseintothefuture/Broken_Social_Scene_-_anthems.mp3
