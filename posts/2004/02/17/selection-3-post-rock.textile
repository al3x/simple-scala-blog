h1. Selection 3: Post-Rock

Tuesday night is theme/genre night on Selection 3, and tonight’s genre being explored is Post-Rock, in large part because I’m still sorting out the tech for more “mixable” styles of music.  But that’s not to belittle the post-rock sound, so named for its use of traditional rock instruments and, to a degree, musical elements, but taken in vastly different directions.  If anything, a parallel between chamber music and some classic music would be more apt, particularly in the cases of the Godspeed! camp and Rachel’s.  Expect to hear lengthy songs that build in tempo and intensity, simple themes and melodies repeated and explored, and vocals taking second-stage to lush instrumentation.  I’ve got a few different takes on the post-rock sound in here, but if you tune in for anything, tune in for “Christmas Steps” by Mogwai, which I’m thrilled to play in its entirety on the radio.  *Listen in on "%(=caps)WMBC%":http://wmbc.umbc.edu from 8-9PM %(=caps)EST%.*
