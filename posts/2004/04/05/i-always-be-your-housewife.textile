h1. I'll Always Be Your Housewife

"CocoRosie":http://www.konzert-buero.de/bands/cocorosie/ could be really poorly described as "Portishead but way strange," but that doesn't really bring across much more than the vague similarity in vocal stylings.  If you like music by weird girls (Bjork, Tori Amos, etc. etc.) you'll like this just as much.
