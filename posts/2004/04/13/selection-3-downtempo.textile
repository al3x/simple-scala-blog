h1. Selection 3: Downtempo
Not at a lot to say about tonight’s mix, other than that it’s sweet and beautiful and you’ll love it.  Tracks jump around in country of origin, sound, and release year, but never anything less than a relaxing groove.  Gonna try to remember to record it this time, too, for those of you who can’t *tune in tonight 8PM %(=caps)EST% on "%(=caps)WMBC%":http://wmbc.umbc.edu*.
