The time is finally nigh.  "5dots":http://www.5dots.net/ releases _Disaster Action Kid_, his first full-length CD, on our "Adjective Records":http://www.adjectiverecords.com label April 27th.  He’s announced as much "here":http://www.5dots.net/news/archives/000035.html.

To celebrate, we’re having a release party, announced "here":http://www.adjectiverecords.com/index.php?p=8.  The nitty gritty:

  Saturday, April 30th at "The Warehouse Next Door":http://www.warehousetheater.com
  1017 7th Street NW, Washington DC
  Doors at 9, $8
  All ages

We’ve got several great acts before the big 5 does his thing.  I’ll be spinning between the other band’s sets all night and then softening up the place for 5dots with a crazed genre-demolishing mix of my own.

Attendance is clearly mandatory.
