h1. The Apartment

"Phil":http://www.superfuturecity.com/ and I got the apartment we wanted.  We’ll be living "here":http://www.madisonvictorian.com/ our floorplan is "this one":http://www.madisonvictorian.com/unit_d.html.  The rental prices listed on that site aren’t accurate, as the competitive and struggling DC real estate market rendered this unfathomably beautiful place comfortably in our price range with amenities you wouldn’t believe.  We’re stunned and excited.

I move in mid-May, and Phil follows in June when the lease is up on his current pad.  Expect a housewarming shindig suitable of this seriously swank domicile.
