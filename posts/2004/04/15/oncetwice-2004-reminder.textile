h1. Once.Twice 2004 Reminder

In or around Baltimore?  Like experimental electronic music, or open to new sounds?  Then you want to be at one or all of the nights of the "Once.Twice Festival":http://www.oncetwicesound.com/festival/.

All ages / Doors open @ 8pm / ADMISSION $10

I’ll be at all three nights, and I’m happy to take DC denizens up to Bmore on Friday after work.
