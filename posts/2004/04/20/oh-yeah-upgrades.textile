h1. Oh Yeah, The Upgrades

Not really much new to say about yesterday's iBook and PowerBook G4 "speed bumps":http://www.macnn.com/news/24282.  It's nice that 802.11g is now standard on the PowerBooks.  But really, like every other Mac-maniac out there (particularly those of us with ailing machines), I was hoping for a PowerBook G5.  Greg Joswiak, Apple vice-president of hardware product marketing, "suggests to the BBC":http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3639825.stm that "it will be some time before [the G5] will be in a notebook."

Crap.  I mean, I understand why it's taking so long to deliver, from a technical perspective.  But I just know my iBook will die right before the PowerBook G5 hits the streets.  I'll inevitably end up shelling out for one of these updated PowerBook G4 15"s that will be utterly primitive once the G5 is out.  That's just the way it goes.

Of course, I could break my Apple allegiance and get a "pastel ThinkPad":http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/04/20/ibm_colour_thinkpads/.  Or, y'know, not.
