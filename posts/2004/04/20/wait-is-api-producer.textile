h1. Wait, Is API A Producer?

Being a junglist and a programmer simultaneously can be confusing.

An "announcement":http://news.php.net/article.php?group=php.pear.general&amp;article=11976 on the general PHP PEAR newsgroup for a new release of the XML_SaxFilters package included this caveat:

bq. WARNING: lots of API breakage!

If you don’t get why that’s funny, it’s not worth explaining.
