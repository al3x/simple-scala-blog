Being a junglist and a programmer simultaneously can be confusing.
An "announcement":http://news.php.net/article.php?group=php.pear.general&amp;article=11976 on the general %(=caps)PHP PEAR% newsgroup for a new release of the %(=caps)XML%_SaxFilters package included this caveat:

If you don’t get why that’s funny, it’s not worth explaining.
