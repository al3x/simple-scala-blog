h1. Controlling

My set tonight went really well, but working around the "Evolution X-Session UC-17":http://www.evolution.co.uk/products/evo_xsession.htm is not exactly intuitive.  It in no way mirrors the layout of Traktor, which in turn attempts to mimic a traditional DJ setup.  This slows down mixing, as my hands have to translate from the deck-mixer-deck screen layout to the long-stupid-rows-of-knobs of the X-Session.  Fortunately it's not too much of a setback, as years of video games have got my brain quite comfortable with disassociating tactile controls from their visual results ("hit top button, guy on screen shoots gun... yes, of course!").

But "this controller":http://faderfox.de/Faderfox-Homepage_english/DJ1_english/body_dj1_english.html, on the other hand, is designed from the ground up for Traktor, and I lust after it.  Unfortunately its German designer apparently needs a US business license to ship direct to the States, thus complicating its acquisition.  Still, this is the controller that Native Instruments or some other industry manufacturer should be looking to license.
