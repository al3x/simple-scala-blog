h1. Where The Desktops At?

So, it's a terribly _net_ question to ask, but where did you find your desktop picture/background?  Bully for you camera buffs with nice photos to use, but what about the rest of us?  I've looked in all the obvious and Google-proffered places for nice widescreen desktops for the new machine (named "Akarui" this evening, meaning "bright") to no avail.  Links appreciated.
