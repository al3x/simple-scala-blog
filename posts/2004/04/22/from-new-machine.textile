h1. From The New Machine

I'm writing this from my new machine, which I purchased from an Apple retail store because of oddness about not being able to split payment between two methods via their online and phone sales.  Because the retail stores don't have custom configurations I ended up with a SuperDrive I likely won't use (but don't really mind) and a standard 4200 RPM hard drive rather than a 5400.  The machine is superb: one ignorable dead pixel on a screen as bright and large as a thousand suns.  And I keep turning out the lights to see the keyboard backlighting.

My old iBook is going to a friend-of-a-friend for a fair price given its suffering under my ownership, where I am sure it will have a good home.  I might ping it every now and again, just to be sure it's okay.
