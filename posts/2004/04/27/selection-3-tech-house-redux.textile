h1. Selection 3: Tech-House Redux
Tonight’s show will revisit the dubby tech-house selection I had pieced together in Ableton Live some months back, this time shooting for a smoother mix in Traktor.  Some of the tracks will be familiar if tuned in the first time around, and I’m throwing in some funky new musical acquisitions to spice it up.  Of course, if you didn’t tune in the first time it’ll all be new to you!  
As is becoming customary, an %(=caps)MP3% will be be made available, but that’s no reason not to listen in live at *8PM %(=caps)EST% on "%(=caps)WMBC%":http://wmbc.umbc.edu/!*
