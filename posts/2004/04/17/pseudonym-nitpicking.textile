h1. Pseudonym Nitpicking

I can’t complain too much.  Plenty of people out there refer to me by my handle, indulging me in the “3” that graces this URL, my email address, and my accounts in various forums and communities around the Net.  I rarely get too much flack about it, either.  I’d like to think I’ve earned my “3”, having adopted it well before the days of commoners speaking "l33t":http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A787917 and backed it up with geek cred.  I’ve been strongly considering making the “3” my next tattoo.  I digress.

I’m not so attached to my handle that I expect to always be referred to by it; I don’t mind “Alex” or “Alexander”.  But I would ask that if referring to me by my handle you not capitalize the “a”: that is, please refer to me as “al3x”, not “Al3x”.  The latter looks typographically awkward.
