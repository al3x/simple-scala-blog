h1. What? No Ear Plates?

If I was building a crazy nearly-life-size "anime girl model with a computer inside her":http://sae.cside.com/sae/kat/pc/ern005/ekana.htm I wouldn't just use some random drawing.  I'd model it after "Chii":http://www.animechains.com/chobits/images_show.cfm?maxi=13&amp;image=anime3.jpg&amp;ep=Images from "Chobits":http://www.animechobits.com/, because then it makes _sense_ that she's got "cables running out of her":http://www.animechains.com/chobits/screen_show.cfm?maxi=30&amp;image=7&amp;ep=2.

_Sigh_.  Once an anime dork, always an anime dork.
