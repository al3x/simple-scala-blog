h1. Tonight’s Show: Al3x Hearts Traktor

I’m having so much fun mixing in Traktor since it arrived last week that I decided to eschew all genre focus and just play a really enjoyable set that takes advantage of the software’s ability to facilitate elegant mixes across styles and %(=caps)BPM% gaps.  Tonight’s mix jumps around from breaks to minimal techno to garage to house to downtempo to electronica; there’s something for everyone to enjoy.
