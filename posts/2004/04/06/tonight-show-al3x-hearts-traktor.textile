h1. Tonight's Show: Al3x Hearts Traktor

I'm having so much fun mixing in Traktor since it arrived last week that I decided to eschew all genre focus and just play a really enjoyable set that takes advantage of the software's ability to facilitate elegant mixes across styles and BPM gaps.  Tonight's mix jumps around from breaks to minimal techno to garage to house to downtempo to electronica; there's something for everyone to enjoy.
