h1. Social Pariah

That is, both me and my city.

The latter first: the "Times":http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/13/technology/circuits/13dodg.html?ex=1399780800&amp;en=be8201c66aacdb53&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND gets stiff over Dodgeball, but damned if DC is a good enough "target market":http://dodgeball.com/social/switch_cities.php for something that hip and techy.

But we are chock full of people who care too much about politics and need to get laid, hence Act for Love's "Vast Left-Wing Conspiracy Happy Hour":http://www.takeactiongetaction.com/party/, which is where I'd be this evening if I were five months older.  That's right: I can vote, I can drive, I can die for my country, but I can't buy martinis for cute Kerry campaign intern chicks.  And they call this a democracy.
