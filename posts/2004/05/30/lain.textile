I’m spending this lazy three-day-weekend afternoon engrossed in "Lain":http://www.animenfo.com/animetitle,371,nxigxj,serial_experime.html, the seminal anime miniseries that I try to make a mental pilgrimage to at once a year to revel in its brilliance.  The sheer level of detail – technical, graphic, auditory, plot, or otherwise – is staggering.   It’s simply a masterpiece.

Note to self: Lain desktop backgrounds to be found "here":http://www.wallpaper-desktop.net/index.shtml?show=gall&amp;cat=manga&amp;gall=serial_experiments_lain and even better "here":http://anarka.org/lain/index.php.
