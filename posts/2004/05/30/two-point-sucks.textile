h1. Two-point-sucks?
So apparently "%(=caps)GNOME 2%.6 sucks":http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/software/story/0,10801,92934,00.html big time?  Anybody have first-hand experience with it?
I’ve half a mind to get an x86 box, ironically largely to run VMWare.  Virtual PC is abysmal, even on my PowerBook G4.  I’m not sure even then how much I’d use much %(=caps)GUI% stuff – certainly not the full-on %(=caps)GNOME% desktop.
