h1. Food Blogging
Phil has been "blogging":http://superfuturecity.com/ photos of what he and I are cooking in our "beautiful kitchen":http://superfuturecity.com/archives/000044.html.  Iâ€™ll probably be doing the same with stuff I cook for myself.
Tonight we made marinaded steaks under the broiler, herb salad with bleu cheese dressing, onion bread pudding with gruyere, and a fresh ginger and peach cobbler.  Cooking rules.
