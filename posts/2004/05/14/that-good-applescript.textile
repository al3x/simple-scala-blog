h1. That’s Good AppleScript

Nice little "script":http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20040512170804933 over at MacOSXHints that updates your iChat status based on your network connection, either subnet or wireless SSID.  I’ve got it set up to report when I’m at the apartment and when I’m at the PICnet offices.  Probably not one for the road warriors, but handy.
