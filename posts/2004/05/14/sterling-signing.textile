h1. Sterling Signing

I think I'm gonna go see "Bruce Sterling":http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/sterling/index.blog?entry_id=312175 talk in Arlington tonight and hopefully get my copy of his latest, "The Zenith Angle," signed.  I'll take notes on his talk and post them here.

If you're curious and in the DC Metro area note that the venue (Olsson's bookstore) is right across the street from the Courthouse station on the Orange Line.  If you're going to be there, give me a shout.  I'll be one of about ten guys with glasses in black t-shirts with PowerBooks, I'm guessing.
