h1. The DC Perspective on Reagan

"This piece":http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A23386-2004Jun7.html?nav=rss_metro in today's Washington Post is one of the only pieces from the multitudes pouring out about the deceased former President that I've liked.  It is not positive and admiring, nor is it vengeful, petty, or disrespectful.  The piece tells it like it is, with a justified air of sadness for the lives affected by Reagan and his administration.

I despise partisan politics even more than the policies of the Reagan era and their lasting effects, which I disagree with from an independent perspective.  Watching liberals and conservatives duke it out over the man's corpse has been disgusting.  Every liberal who thinks he's doing the world a favor by holding his tongue on the negative aspects of the Reagan years while memorials drag on this week is a disingenuous coward; every conservative manipulating this chance for respectful reminiscing and historical perspective to further her platform is an opportunistic graverobber.
