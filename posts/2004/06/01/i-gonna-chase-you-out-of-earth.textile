h1. I’m Gonna Chase You Out of Earth

“99 Problems” may be Jay-Z’s big single right now, but the Kayne West-produced “Lucifer” is my present favorite on _The Black Album_.  The dub/reggae flavor of the track, its brevity and purposeful production, and the juxtaposition of the easy-riding groove with the tense guitar strumming and the pressure of the refrain (“I’m from the murder capital / where we murder for capital”) all make it a sleeper standout.  I doubt it’ll make its way to the radio after “99 Problems,” but it deserves its place in any solid summery dubby DJ set – or your iPod.
