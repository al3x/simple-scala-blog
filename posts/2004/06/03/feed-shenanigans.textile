h1. Feed Shenanigans
If you were seeing formatting characters in my %(=caps)RSS% feed before, you shouldn’t be now (unsubscribe and re-subscribe in NetNewsWire, "Scott":http://www.holeinthebox.com/ ^_^).  The error stemmed from an unformatted ampersand slipping by WordPress’s filters, thus invalidating my feed and causing it to misrender.  Woo.  Bugs.
