h1. Where Did That Code Go?
If you were using "acts_as_sanitized":http://actsassanitized.devjavu.com/ for (rudimentary) scrubbing of your Rails application's data, you'll now find it at "http://actsassanitized.devjavu.com":http://actsassanitized.devjavu.com/.  If you previously had issues or patches with the plugin, please share them there.
If you're looking for the twitter_monitor.rb script that displays your Twitter updates via Growl you'll now find it at "http://static.al3x.net/twitter_monitor.rb":http://static.al3x.net/twitter_monitor.rb.  Now that "Twitterrific":http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific does Growl, though, I don't know why you'd use it.
I'm also sharing the code I used to migrate my blog from a custom Rails application to Blogger.  You'll find that at "http://static.al3x.net/blogger_import.py":http://static.al3x.net/blogger_import.py.  It requires SQL Alchemy and some other libraries.  Much of the code is ganked from the "Blogger API Python developer's guide":http://code.google.com/apis/blogger/developers_guide_python.html, but it's got a few tricks that someone might find useful.
Lastly, you'll find my old TextPattern export scripts at "http://static.al3x.net/export_moveabletype.php":http://static.al3x.net/export_moveabletype.php and "http://static.al3x.net/txp_update_comment_count.php.":http://static.al3x.net/txp_update_comment_count.php  I hope you don't need them, though.
