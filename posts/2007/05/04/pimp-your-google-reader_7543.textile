h1. Pimp Your Google Reader
If you’d like to use John Hicks’s lovely Mac-like "Google Reader":http://google.com/reader/ "theme":http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/google-reader-theme-fixed-again in Safari, he suggests you use Safari Stand.  I, personally, am not a Stand fan, as it’s not been so much with the working.  My ideal Safari is served with Saft, Inquisitor, and PithHelmet.  The latter option can theme Reader just dandy.  Here’s how:

Install "PithHelmet":http://www.culater.net/software/PithHelmet/PithHelmet.php if necessary.
Download the "theme":http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/google-reader-theme-fixed-again.
In Safari, hop over to Reader.
In the PithHelmet sub-menu, click Show Site Preferences.
In the “Matching Pattern” box enter http://www.google.com/reader/* and choose “Wildcard Match” from the menu below.
In the “Style” tab, open up the “Custom style sheet” drop-down and choose the Safari/Opera version of Hicks’s theme.
Double-check your settings and hit “Apply”.

Refresh and you should be golden, barring any problems with the theme itself.  I’ve been spending increasingly more time in Firefox, where the theme seems a bit more stable.
