h1. Beer Blogging

I'm providing a very minor contribution to my friend Craig's relatively new beer blog, dubbed "Beers Beers Beers":http://beersbeersbeers.blogspot.com.  Craig is blogging up a veritable storm in a stein.  I don't expect to match him in either frequency or knowledge of brewing, but hopefully I can at least contribute in quality of prose and Left Coast beer selections.  Subscribe, if you will.
