h1. Mac Software I Own Licenses For
Even after years of using and contributing to open source software, I think good software is worth paying for.  To inspire gift ideas this holiday season, here's a list of the Mac software I own licenses for:

"1Password":http://1passwd.com/ - the best password manager ever.
"BluePhoneElite":http://mirasoftware.com/BPE2/ - when I had a phone this was compatible with, it was awesome.   Control your phone from your desktop, pause music when you get calls, all kinds of future-is-now stuff.
"growliChat": - long since rendered obsolete, but was worth paying for at the time.  Hooks up the Growl notification system to iChat.
"Hazel":http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php - moves around files for me.  I mostly use it to file away downloads and clean up after deleting applications.
"MailPlane":http://mailplaneapp.com/ - A lovely Cocoa wrapper around Gmail.  The best of the web and the desktop.  This is how I survive email.
"MarsEdit":http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/ - I'm writing this blog post in it.
"NetNewsWire":http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/ - if I could tear myself away from Google Reader, I'd probably read my feeds with this.  I used to live in it.
"PandoraJam":http://www.bitcartel.com/pandorajam/ - another web/desktop fusion, this time making the Pandora streaming music service a joy to use on your Mac.
"PodWorks":http://www.scifihifi.com/podworks/ - it gets music off your iPhone or iPod.  Essential.
"SuperDuper":http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html - the only backup utility I have total and complete faith in.
"TextMate":http://www.macromates.com/ - the ur-editor.  All the power and flexibility of arcane editors like Vim and Emacs with a beautiful Mac face.
"Twitterific":http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific - how I interact with Twitter more often than not.
"Videobox":http://tastyapps.com/ -  a simple, cute way to get videos off of sites like YouTube and Google Video and onto your iPhone or hard drive.
"Visual Hub":http://www.techspansion.com/visualhub/ - a simple, fast way to get other kinds of videos onto your iPhone or iPod.
"Xtorrent":http://www.xtorrentp2p.com/ - My preferred Torent client.  Subscribe to feeds of torrents (great for shows) or search right from the application.  Speedy and stable.
"Yep":http://www.yepthat.com/yep/index.html - they say "like iPhoto for your PDFs", I say it's more like iTunes.  Regardless, I can't live/work without it. 

I've also been given licenses for the following applications by their generous, attractive developers:

"Acorn":http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/ - a superb, lightweight image editor that completely obviates the need for me to keep Photoshop on my system.
"Pukka":http://codesorcery.net/pukka/ - a pleasant way to save bookmarks to del.icio.us on your Mac.
"VoodooPad Pro":http://www.flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/voodoopadpro.html - a desktop wiki notebook thing that I use from time to time.

Good software is good.  Buy some!
