h1. Excising Feeds
Despite the positive comments on my poll a while back about whether on not to leave "my del.icio.us links":http://del.icio.us/al3x in this blog’s feed, I’ve decided to remove them.  Too many irked friends.
My suggestion: "add me to your network":http://del.icio.us/help/network on del.icio.us and subscribe to a combined feed for all your friends.  I started doing this a couple weeks back.  It’s handy.
Or: subscribe directly to "my del.icio.us feed":http://del.icio.us/rss/al3x.
It’s probably not even worth mentioning that, while I don’t post here all that frequently, I post a lot over at "Twitter":http://twitter.com/al3x.
