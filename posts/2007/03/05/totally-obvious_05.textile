h1. Totally Obvious

I'm happy to announce that today is my first official day as a full-time "Obvious":http://obvious.com/ employee.

If you're a frequent visitor to the "About Us":http://twitter.com/help/aboutus page on "Twitter":http://www.twitter.com/, you'll notice that I've been on there for a while.  That's because I've been doing contract work on Twitter since earlier this year.

Our recent trip to San Francisco was in part to see if I liked working with the Obvious folks and vice versa.  I definitely did, and T and I will be moving to San Francisco in the near future.

I'm looking forward to continuing to improve "Twitter":http://www.twitter.com/.  It's been great fun to work on something that so many people are enthusiastic about.  But more than that, I'm looking forward to working with the awesome people at Obvious.  It's a great place to be.
