h1. Totally Obvious
Im happy to announce that today is my first official day as a full-time "Obvious":http://obvious.com/ employee.
If youre a frequent visitor to the "About Us":http://twitter.com/help/aboutus page on "Twitter":http://www.twitter.com/, youll notice that Ive been on there for a while.  Thats because Ive been doing contract work on Twitter since earlier this year.
Our recent trip to San Francisco was in part to see if I liked working with the Obvious folks and vice versa.  I definitely did, and "Timoni":http://www.synergizement.com/ and I will be moving to San Francisco in the near future.
Im looking forward to continuing to improve "Twitter":http://www.twitter.com/.   Its been great fun to work on something that so many people are enthusiastic about.  But more than that, Im looking forward to working with the awesome people at Obvious.  Its a great place to be.
