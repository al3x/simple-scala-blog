h1. Instinct and Intuition

You probably know if it's going to work.  Other people will, too.  If you have to sell it to yourself and sell it to them, it just won't take.

What am I talking about?  I think the above applies to everything from marketing to design to relationships, but I'm really talking about process.  The geek community is obsessed with process, whether business or personal.  We want to know how successful teams work, and we want to know the nitty-gritty of how "smart individuals organize themselves":http://www.craphound.com/lifehacksetcon04.txt.   The geek obsession with process has gone from the fringes to the mainstream in several short years, tidily intersecting with the market for self-help and business books.

The thing is, formality isn't the same as a solid process.  You can pick a sequence to follow in your work and life - a sequence you've seen on blogs or in books - but that doesn't mean it's the _right_ sequence for you.  What works for people is what comes naturally.

Processes like Getting Real are just codifications of common sense.  If organizations weren't intent on adopting rigid, slightly batty processes like Agile and Scrum, nobody would be able to sell common sense as an alternative.

Once you're talking about process and not operating on instinct and intuition, you've already drifted away from your most effective, harmonious work.
