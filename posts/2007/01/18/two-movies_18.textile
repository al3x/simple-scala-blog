In order of viewing.

"Children of Men":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0206634/ is not a science fiction film.  It's not about the future, and its not about what life on earth would be like if the human species went sterile.  Its a film about war, and about right now.  The metaphor of a world without children  that is, a world without a future  is devastating.  I found it hard to watch and harder to look away.

"Pan's Labyrinth":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430/ (_El Laberinto del Fauno_) is also about war and children, and is not the escapist fantasy that one might expect.  It's a relentlessly violent film, and much of that violence is deeply personal.  Again, hard to watch, but utterly beautiful.  The politics and history are masterfully interwoven.

Both highly recommended.
