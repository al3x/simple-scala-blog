h1. Attending: SXSW Interactive 2007
I just nailed down my "flight":http://www.aa.com/, "hotel":http://www.wyndham.com/hotels/AUSWC/main.wnt, and registration for "South by Southwest Interactive 2007":http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/ (SXSWi).  Ill be there Saturday through Tuesday, strictly for the Interactive portion of the conference.
SXSWi has come recommended to me for some time, but the wishy-washy content of many of the panels and keynotes never sold me.  Over the years Ive realized that what everyone says about conferences is true: its not about the content, its about the conversations between talks.
Ive also come to grips with my preternatural affection for the social end of the technology field, and SXSWi is the foremost gathering place for that scene.  Im not really certain if Ill be able to get through four days of talks like Web 2.0 / 3.0 Arts Entrepreneurship: Make Your Passion Your Profession and Parent Bloggers 2.0: Can Diaper Diarists Make Real Dollars? with my patience intact, but Im looking forward to meeting the people who make the social web happen.
If any readers are attending or know somebody nice who is, please do comment.
