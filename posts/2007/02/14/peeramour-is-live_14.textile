h1. Peeramour Is Live

The site I announced a while back, "Peeramour":http://www.peeramour.com/, is now live and accepting testers.

I wanted to have the whole thing up and running on the 14th, but I also want to do the proper launch right.  The testing phase wont last forever, just long enough to get feedback from a group of motivated early adopters.

Happy Valentines day.
