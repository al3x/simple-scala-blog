h1. Next Week: San Francisco

We'll be in San Francisco from Sunday the 18th to Sunday the 25th.  It's a business trip for me and a vacation for T.  We're staying downtown, near "MoMA":http://www.sfmoma.org/.

If you're in the Yay Area you'd like to hang out, let me know.  We should be free in the evenings.  I'm going to try to revisit old haunts and explore some new ones.
