h1. Horrible Phone Nation, Issue #71345

A friend was having problems with a series of Motorola Qs, and complained to his carrier until they agreed to give him a new phone.  I asked what kind of phone he was getting.

An "%(=caps)LG VX8600%":http://www.mobiledia.com/phones/lg/vx8600.html, he replied.  The tech said its had the lowest complaints of the past 3 months.

What a way to buy a phone, or anything else for that matter.  I'll take whatever sucks least.
