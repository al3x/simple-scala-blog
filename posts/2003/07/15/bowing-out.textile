Last night’s "Audio Dregs":http://www.audiodregs.com/ label showcase show over at the Galaxy Hut was personally illuminating.  Sure, I found Lullatone and E-Rock to be boring, derivative Nobozaku Takemoura rip-offs, but that’s pretty subjective.  What was fairly concrete for me was hearing Greg Davis, whose largely intolerable mess of drones, indecipherable re-samples, and static reminded me almost immediately of, well, me.  His set was, for all intents and purposes, a painfully extended version of the droney mess I "played":http://www.al3x.net/mt/archives/000160.html at the last Open Minijax event at the Black Cat.  Having to sit through that made it terribly apparent: I should not be making music.

It’s coincidental, as it happens: faced with the prospect of several upcoming shows and utterly lacking in any musical ideas, I would likely have churned out yet another long, dull, easy-to-create drone soup.  Knowing that full well I had been considering dropping out of these commitments, but it wasn’t until last night that this became a formal decision.  I just have no desire to make music, and it seems a shame to inflict half-hearted crap on listeners.  I still intend to remix things every now and then, and probably DJ here and there, but neither of those involve me “making” music, per se.  My creative energies are elsewhere, simple as that.
