h1. My Ears And Hair

My ears have gone through a fair number of modifications and recovery periods since about 7th grade when I first got my left ear pierced.  Since then the other lobe has been pierced, both have been stretched (at different times), and the left ear has survived a botched 4ga dermal punch in the cartilage and a rather nasty keloid.  When I finally got both ears balanced with 2ga stainless steel double-flared tunnels I was relieved.  But with the recent discovery that my left ear has been slowly keloiding around the tunnel, I think it’s time to give up on stretched ears.  Coincidentally, I’m no longer so pleased with how they make me look, so it seems like a good time to take ‘em out and start with the “scar therapy” pads (a good keloid remedy), which is exactly what I did this evening.

Much more mundane, but similarly vain: I need a good haircut.  The whole spiky-hair thing makes me look like a gay punk rocker, and that’s not the image I want to convey as a newly-single and decidedly straight non-rocker.  Any of you out there in the DC blog scene have recommendations on a good place for a haircut?  The less Hair Cuttery-caliber while still being affordable the better.  Cheers.
