h1. iPod No More?

With my lengthy and frequent summer school commutes from Bethesda to Baltimore about to end for the summer I'm considering selling my 30GB iPod.  It was a lot of money – money I only sort of have – and I can't see myself using it too often come fall's return to college life, save at the gym on campus.

Moreover, I get the distinct feeling that Apple won't release what I consider to be the iPod's killer app (beyond being the best damn portable audio device around): portable stereo realtime-encoded audio with an interface that works.  There's too small a market for such an add-on, and it would cause many the IP legal headache if it becomes concert bootlegger's new best friend.  Such recording capabilities will likely lie dormant in the 3G iPods, or will be exploited in a markedly un-useful way, like being built into a bulky revised dock.
All that said: **anyone wanna buy an iPod?**  I'll throw in headphones that don't suck.  Make me an offer I can't refuse before change my mind or eBay the thing.
