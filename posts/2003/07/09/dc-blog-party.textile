h1. DC Blog Party

"Phil and I":http://sexxi.al3x.net/ were "there":http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/PartyInDC030707, and we have proof: see the far right of "this picture":http://jason.defillippo.com/blog/archives/000258.phtml.  Fun conversation, great people, and I even ran into an old "acquaintance":http://www.bensherman.org/.  Gotta do this socializing thing more often.
