h1. Meeting People Is Easy (2)

Or, more accurately, sites by which one can meet people are easy to use.  I’ve got embarrassingly formulaic profiles up on a couple of dating sites; scan the competition and you realize that young geeky hipsters are a dime a dozen.  Fortunately, I’m faster, stronger, lacking in unnecessary wind resistance, and in compliance with a variety of international standards for maximum interoperability, all of which my peers cannot accurately claim.  I’d say my prospects are good.  But then, I’m full of shit.

I did take the "Friendster":http://www.friendster.com/ plunge in this frenzy of dating site prostitution, so if you’d like to be validated as “my friend,” or vice versa, feel free.  If they published "FOAF":http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-foaf.html I’d be more impressed, but it’s still pretty keen.  So now I just sit back and wait for a meaningful, fulfilling relationship to fall into my lap, right?  Great.
