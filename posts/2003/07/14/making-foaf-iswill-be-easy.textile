h1. Making FOAF Is/Will Be Easy

So say you wanna get on this whole %(=caps)FOAF% thing, to “ride da %(=caps)FOAF% donkey,” as it were.  Right now there’s the web form-based "%(=caps)FOAF%-a-matic":http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic.html, and that’s not a bad solution.  But pretty soon there’s gonna be "HandShake":http://danhon.com/ec/mtarchives/000573.shtml#000573 for Mac %(=caps)OS X%, an easy to use desktop app for viewing and editing %(=caps)FOAF% files that can also graph your network of friends.  And that will be hella cool.

Where am I getting all these k-rad %(=caps)FOAF% links, you ask?  Why, from the "RDFWeb %(=caps)FOAF% Project blog":http://rdfweb.org/, of course.  I wouldn’t look too closely or you’ll realize how shamelessly I’ve been yoinking their content.
Oh yeah, and I’ve got "my own %(=caps)FOAF% file":http://www.al3x.net/foaf.rdf up, too (see a respectable "FoaF Explorer view":http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/explorer/?foaf=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.al3x.net%2Ffoaf.rdf of it).  I hope you’re allowed to refer to people you’ve only met in a fairly cursory fashion as “friends” for community-building purposes.  If not, the social software gestapo (which surely exists) will be on my ass in like 10 minutes.
