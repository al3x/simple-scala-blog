h1. Menus Like Joi? And More

I was doing Dynamic %(=caps)HTML% back in the fucking _day_.  Seriously.  But by and large having things zooming all about your web pages courtesy of %(=caps)CSS% and JavaScript didn’t prove too useful, and it died off as being terribly 1996, at least in my book.  That’s why I was pleasantly surprised at the new layout of "Joi’s site":http://joi.ito.com/, which hides the usual massive list of blog extras in some simple, elegant drop-down menus.  Should I look into something like this for my site’s redesign?  Or do y’all enjoy the huge list o’ details and blogroll and such?
Also, the Related Entries stuff doesn’t seem to be working too well. My %(=caps)SQL% queries are pretty lenient, but nonetheless I hardly seem to get any results at all.  Worth keeping around?  And sorry "Allan":http://biogeek04.tripod.com/, but those moblog posts are going right in the blog. Smack in that sucker.  But there won’t be many, ‘cause I’m picky and interesting things don’t happen in front of me very often.
