h1. Note To Y’all

Stole that cat’s design ;-)  A few tweaks here and there, but the essential clean all-CSS look is the same.  I’m now grafting it on to the archives.  The color scheme, by the way, is my favorite mix of blues and grays that a friend of mine calls the “sad cloud” palate.  I’ve used it for years on my various sites and it never ceases to please (me).

*UPDATED:* All done!  Enjoy the new look, and thanks again to Matthew Rothenberg for his lovely layout.  Hopefully he’ll update his blog sometime soon… with a post about people ripping him off ;-)
