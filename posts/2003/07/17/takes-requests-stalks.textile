h1. Takes Requests. Stalks.

Tony Pierce has a "vanity domain":http://www.tonypierce.com/, and on it a "blog":http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/bloggy.htm.  The other day he had a long, amusing "post":http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/2003_07_13_blogarc.htm#105830359651621061 about Friendster girls (a recent topic of interest to me), which concluded in the sentence "[A]nd one day my children will ask me why i married their mother and i will say ["]boredom and defeat.["]  [A]nd then i will ask him not to talk to me for the rest of the evening if its ok with them" (punctuation and capitalization mine, non-agreeing pronouns his).

So I left, in all good humor, a comment on that post requesting, "Please do not have children."  In what is apparently his style, or 'steez,' he used my comment as inspiration for another thoroughly entertaining self-reflecting little "blog nugget":http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/2003_07_13_blogarc.htm#105841412767294069.  And then AIM'd me to say so.  And has apparently checked out the IP from which I posted.
Nicholas Chase I'm now quite comfortable with.  This Pierce character, on the other hand... ;-)
