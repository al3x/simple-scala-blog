h1. Ahead of the Beer Curve

Dan over at SimpleBits has a "few clear bullets":http://www.simplebits.com/200307#1059102352 on why Jamaican export Red Stripe is, well, good.  I got hooked on the stuff when sailing around the %(=caps)BVI% this past Christmas holiday.  The cheaper local brew there is Carib, but only touristas are caught drinking it – would you trust beer in a clear glass bottle that sits on a hot dock during shipment?  Red Stripe, on the other hand, is sensibly shipped in squat, dark brown bottles.  It’s the perfect boat beer, and compliments most light summer meals.  Cheers indeed, Dan.
