h1. On Remixing

Having bowed out of making my own music, remixing and DJing is pretty much all I do on the audio front.  Which is fine: I like remixing and DJing far better than coming up with my own stuff, in part because molding someone else's material into something new and different is a fun challenge, and in part because I'm lazy.  To that end, "today's Diesel Sweeties":http://www.dieselsweeties.com./archive.php?s=737 has an amusing take on remixing from the original artist's perspective.

And yeah, what the hell's up with comics not syndicating in RSS/Atom/whatever?  I mean, it's not like they need the revenue that comes from ad banners and Cafe Press clothes to finance their astronomical hosting hosts or anything.  "Jerks":http://www.jerkcity.com/."
