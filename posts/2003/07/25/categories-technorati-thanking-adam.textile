h1. Categories, Technorati, Thanking Adam Kalsey

I’ve broadened the categories in which I file my posts here to better reflect several of my key interests.  You’ll now find InfoTech Policy and Information Security categories, separate from the Technology and Politics labels under which those topics previously got placed.  In addition, my moblog now has a category all its own, and despite previous denouncements, Metablogging (blogging about blogging) is recognized as a necessary byproduct of being interested in the blog scene.  Finally, to separate out Apple-related posts from the rest of my musings on technology a Mac category has been added.  This should keep things neatly filed away, and ideally encourage me write about infotech  and infosec policy more, which I really should given that they’re pretty much my field of study.

In geekier news, it seems whatever problems the Technorati weblog info service was having yesterday have been resolved.  Thanks nonetheless to Adam Kalsey for "updating":http://kalsey.com/2003/07/technorati_fix/ his Technorati MT plugin to be that much more fault-tolerant.  Between that and his help on the Related Entries mySQL hack I totally owe that man coffee.  Or liquor.  Or maybe just money.
