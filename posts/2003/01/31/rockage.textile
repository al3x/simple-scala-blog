Those who know me know that I no longer "rock."  I gave up rock music years ago, dismayed with the seemingly unending repetition coming from 99% of the bands who aspired to rock.  Most things with guitars generally deter me, and almost all things emo/indie/post-rock make me gag.

But, rather belatedly, I've come upon several exceptions to this rule: "Spiritualized":http://www.spiritualized.com/, "The Flaming Lips":http://www.flaminglips.com/main.php, and "Neutral Milk Hotel":http://www.neutralmilkhotel.net/.  Now, for most people, these bands are not average rock music.  But I guess that gives you some sense of just how disconnected from that sound I've become.  All have guitars, employ a verse-chorus-verse songwriting style for most of their numbers, and write songs about rock sorts of things, like love, sex, and death.   Of these bands, I can't get enough of the following songs: ""Cool Waves"":http://www.no-fi.com/spiritualized/ladiesgents_lyrics.html by Spiritualized, ""Holland, 1945"":http://neutralmilkhotel.net/holland.html by Neutral Milk Hotel, and ""Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell"":http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/SongUnid/B3CC1C6529F1C4C148256C14001E1479 by The Flaming Lips.
