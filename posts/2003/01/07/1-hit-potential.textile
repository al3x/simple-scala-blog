h1. #1 Hit Potential

I haven't been too enthused about the Radiohead of the last couple years. But listening to their
live Salamanca show of 7/8/2002 (search the nets, kids) makes me appreciate a couple tracks that are
being considered as singles for their next album. "2 + 2 = 5" rocks out (and rockage rarely appeals
to me these days), and "There There" is quite moving with its mantra-chorus of "just coz you feel
it doesn't mean it's there." My personal favorite is the anti-Los Angeles ""We Suck Young
Blood":http://www.greenplastic.com/lyrics/songs/wesuckyoungblood.html".

I may actually be swayed to pick this thing up when it comes together. But Radiohead still owes me a
live show from the one that got cancelled at the Tibetan Freedom Concert several years back. I don't
forget...
