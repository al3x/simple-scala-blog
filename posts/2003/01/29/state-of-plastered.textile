h1. State of the Plastered

If I had been playing the "State of the Union Drinking Game":http://www.marcmelzer.net/sotudg/, I'd be quite drunk right now.  But there's just not enough alcohol in the tri-state area, and I've got classes .. all the rest of the week.  Because the hangover would take that long to clear up.  I think you get the idea.  Bush, and our cowardly Democratic "opposition," are infuriating.
