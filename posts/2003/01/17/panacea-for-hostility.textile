h1. A Panacea for Hostility

I’m still feeling pretty bent out of shape over Eldred vs Ashcroft, which is linked to bloody well
everywhere and doesn’t need any further griping about, not today anyway. But I like hostile music
for a hostile mood, and the track “Motion Sickness” by Panacea fits the bill perfectly. It’s deep,
dark jungle from a producer not afraid to break the production rules of the drum 'n bass scene. Grab
it on my beloved "Emusic":http://www.emusic.com/cd/10739/10739398.html.
