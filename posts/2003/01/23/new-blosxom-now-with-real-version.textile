h1. New Blosxom, Now With Real Version Numbers!

So, just as the guy from "Sundot":http://www.sundot.com and I were lamenting a few long-standing
Blosxom bugs, Rael goes and "releases":http://www.raelity.org/archives/2003/01/23#blosxom_1_0
Blosxom 1.0 (the first version not to use all sorts of wacky "+"s and "i"s). 1.0 seems to fix this
stuff, though it had a bug of its own that Rael quickly advised me on via the comments/TrackBack
system he just put together for his own blog.

Personally, I'm dying to try out the comments feature and explore the plug-in architecture that's
been in the works for a number of weeks. But cheers to Rael and those who helped with bug fixes for
making Blosxom the most flexible and unique blogging system around!
