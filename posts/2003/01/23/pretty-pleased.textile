h1. Pretty Pleased

So, I’ve settled on a layout I like.  At least one regular reader reports both no rendering problems in Mac IE and agreement that the layout is readable.  I moved away from Waferbaby’s %(=caps)CSS%-only layout, as %(=caps)CSS% is still piss-poor at doing multiple column layouts without lots of kludges and hacks, and even then the results are rarely consistent across browsers and platforms.  But I know this layout renders acceptably in Chimera, Safari and, now, Mac IE.  I’ll flesh out the remaining pages of the new layout with content over the weekend.  Thanks for bearing with me.
