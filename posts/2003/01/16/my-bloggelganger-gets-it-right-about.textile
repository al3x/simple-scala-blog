h1. My Bloggelganger Gets it Right About Avril "Media Creation" Levine

Wozz is sick of hearing about Avril Lavine's street cred.  So am I.  But he
"blogged":http://blogs.salon.com/0001019/2003/01/14.html#a433 on
it, and makes the point that "her" songwriting is a product of the same team
that vomited up the Backstreet Boys' material.  Performance-oriented music
is generally about posturing, and that's fine.  But don't confuse a record industry
product with independent artists.  Oh, and ladies?  Don't embarrass yourselves by
identifying with a sham singer totally designed to get you to identify with her
"girl power" bratty feminism.  Her single was called "skater boi," for fucksakes.
