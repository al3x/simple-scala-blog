h1. Safari: Stunning Beta 1, But Missing Tabs

J'adore Safari. It was love at first sight, with its sleek metal interface and ultrafast page
rendering. It just screams _Apple_, and OS X needed a browser with that degree of sheer
sexiness.

That said, Safari lacks the best feature of Opera and Chimera, the two other rebel
browsers: tabs. Tabs make a lot of sense for a browser: most people usually open several pages. Why
give each page its own window, repeating all the navigational controls and littering the screen? Why
not tabs, to switch easily between pages? Chimera does this with superb results. So if you miss this
in Safari, sign "the petition":http://www.petitiononline.com/safaritb/petition.html. Apple tends to
be pretty responsive about these things.

Now, back to the jungle...
