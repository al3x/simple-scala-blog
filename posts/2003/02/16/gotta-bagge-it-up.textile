h1. Gotta Bagge It Up

Reason magazine is presently running a "short comic":http://www.reason.com/0303/bagge.shtml by Peter Bagge that muses on the ineffectiveness and embarrassments of the American antiwar movement.  He’s a Libertarian of the school that makes me almost identify with that platform, and his criticisms are both apt and biting.  Quote of the day (referring to the  Israeli/Palestinian conflict):

bq. “I [...] resent being forced to subsidize a staging ground for Armageddon, but does that mean I have to ‘root’ for the Palestinians?  Can’t I loathe both sides equally?  Where’s the ‘they can all go to hell’ booth?  I want to volunteer!”

I think I’ve said as much, many times over.  Right on topic, the "CSM":http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0214/p02s02-ussc.html has an article questioning the effectiveness of protests.  The pro-protesters resounding chorus?  “It worked for Vietnam…”  _cough_
