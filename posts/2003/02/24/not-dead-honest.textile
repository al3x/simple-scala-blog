h1. Not Dead. Honest.

I had my first major problem with my iBook these past few days.

Having decided on Native Instrument's Reaktor as the synthesis tool of choice for the album I'm working on, I now had to find a way to run the Mac OS 9-only software.  Yes, Reaktor 3 only works in the old school Mac OS, and despite my love for all things X I'm using it anyway, because it beats the pants off everything else and I can't wait until the April release of OS X-compatible Reaktor 4.  So I did something stupid and tried to do a "Software Restore" of OS 9 on top of my OS X installation, which confused my poor iBook something terrible when I rebooted.  My machine had no idea what, or seemingly __how__, to boot.  I had myself a good panic, then offloaded all my files onto two friends' iBooks using the nifty boot-as-Firewire feature Apple so thoughtfully includes.  Some partitioning and recopying later I have my iBook back in peak health, booting both OSs 9 and X and ready to work in Reaktor.

So how was your weekend?
