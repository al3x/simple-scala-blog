h1. Tonight’s Show: Ambient and Drone

The artists selected for tonight’s show all explore an as-yet-unnamed realm of ambient electronic music, one that I’m personally working in on my album in progress.  The main characteristic of this sound is a fascinating dichotomy between lengthy swaths of ambient/environmental sound and tiny, precise repetitions on the microsound scale.  The total effect is that of a blurry memory, a quiet murmur in the half-lit corner of a room you think you remember.  Sometimes that room is soft and beautiful, a happy childhood memory embodied in sonic space; that’s how Salice, Keith Fullerton Whitman, and perhaps Kid606 remember things.  But Electric Company and Ryoji Ikeda remember the future, and Pablo Reche and RNGMNN are possessed by darkly quiet thoughts.  The full track listing is below.  Tune in and enjoy.
