h1. First Radio Show of the Semester: Indie-Hop!

It's that time again.  Monday night.  7pm.  You have an uncontrollable urge to point your browser to "http://wmbc.umbc.edu":http://wmbc.umbc.edu and listen in on the streaming mp3 webcast of a little show they (read: I) call, "Eclectic Electric."  The first show of the semester is indie-hop, independent hip-hop that speaks on subjects more profound than bling-bling lifestyle and cheap sex.  All the cats on these tracks rock amazing flow, superb production, and generally innovative styles.
