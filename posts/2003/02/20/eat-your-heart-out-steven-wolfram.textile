h1. Eat Your Heart Out, Steven Wolfram

I think it's pretty funny that Sean Booth, one half of experimental electronic gods Autechre, "thinks":http://www.autechre.nu/cgi-bin/newspro/interviews.cgi?newsid1004112934,55737 Steven Wolfram's nature-as-cellular-automata thesis is crap.  It's quite an interview, actually, because the more you dig through Booth's working class English slang and modesty-cum-hostility, you realize he's got an understanding of complex systems, both technical and natural, that probably rivals some academics.  I'm just happy he's using that understanding to make music and not dry academic papers.
