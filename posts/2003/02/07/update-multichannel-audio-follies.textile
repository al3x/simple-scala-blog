h1. Update: Multichannel Audio Follies

[Updated update] Greg St'Peter at M-Audio wrote today, refuting what I had heard over the phone from his company, saying:

bq. "Alexander, you are absolutely correct [about not being able to pre-listen simultaneously on the Ozone].  The reason for this is because the Ozone is only a two channel output device.  you need a four channel output card to do pre listening.  Since the headphone jack is not a separate output, this functionality is not available."

Well, nuts.
