h1. Automatic OPML-to-HTML Blogroll Inside Moveable Type?

My news feed reader of choice, NetNewsWire, can export the list of news feeds I read in an %(=caps)XML%-ish format called %(=caps)OPML%.  It would make a lot of sense to have a Moveable Type plugin that grabbed an %(=caps)OPML% file, either from the web or from a directory on your server, and converted it to a nice, configurable %(=caps)HTML% list.  Obviously the plugin would add a handfull of tags to MT, but if you had some time (I don’t) and could hack some Perl (I won’t) it would be doable.  Heck, the "pieces":http://www.radwin.org/michael/blog/archives/000104.html are already in place.

So, "Lazyweb":http://www.lazyweb.org/, anyone?
