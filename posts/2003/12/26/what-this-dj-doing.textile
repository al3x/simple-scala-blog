h1. What This DJ's Doing

Netlabels.  Netlabels are the answer.

I'm finding so much good stuff at "Hippocamp":http://www.hippocamp.net/ alone it's criminal that they're just giving it away.  Album after album of varying styles, all pure quality, and all inducing the desired DJ effect of making me wince, close my eyes, and smile all in one immensely happy eargasmic facial contraction.

And the upside is that I get to be even more of a labelwhore than DJs who buy from well-known physical distribution labels.  "Oh, is that on Warp?"  "Nah, it's on a tiny little netlabel.  Great stuff, you wouldn't have heard of them."  Ba-zing!
