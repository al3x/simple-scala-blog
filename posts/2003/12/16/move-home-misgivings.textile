h1. Move Home Misgivings

As was probably wholly predictable I’m having some misgivings about a permanent move back home.  And no, it’s not a lack of parental harmony or the cultural annoyances of suburban life; things have been nothing but pleasant and comfortable since I moved back in last week.  It’s that, if anything, life is _too_ comfortable: I’m not challenged to make new friends or otherwise change anything about myself.  Perhaps another semester of social difficulty at %(=caps)UMBC% would be good for me, “build some [proverbial] character” while waiting to see if I can transfer for %(=caps)GWU%.

I just don’t want to go back to the social routine I had fallen into this semester.  If I were to move back to my apartment for the start of the new semester in late January I would be most resolved to make some changes and have the kind of semester I should have had this past Fall.  Hopefully I’ve sorted enough out for myself that I can actually make good on that.

So we’ll see.  I could go either way at this point, and nobody has yet claimed my lease on the apartment, the real deal-breaker.  Should I move back, though, I’m really going to kick myself for having moved all that kitchenware home.  Damn.
