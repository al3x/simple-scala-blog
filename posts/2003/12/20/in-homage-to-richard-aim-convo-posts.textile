B: you’d look awful cute in that picture of you on there. if it weren’t for that face you were making, of course.

me: i’m supposed to look pissed at my phone.

B: what was wrong with it?

me: [...] it was doing something silly that i had to work around.

B: silly?

me: Verizon had it appending basically an advertisement for their service when you sent a picture message. so i would send pics to my moblog, and the program i have set up to read a special email address and post to my weblog in the moblog category was posting that advertisement text along with the pictures

me: i had to change some stuff in that program to throw out their text

me: a minor hassle, and really not my phone’s fault.

B: fucking Verizon.

me: but yeah, that new sweater [...] is really nice. you can’t quite see in the pic, but it’s got a zipper on one shoulder

me: and i like my bang-tastic rocker boy hair

me: (which rocks only very slightly, but more so than when parted)

B: it probably rocks just about enough.

me: right. comfortable, manageable rockage.

B: you wouldn’t want to go overboard with the rock.

me: i can’t back up that much rock.

me: limited rock delivery.

me: i think this tangent is done.

B: yup.
