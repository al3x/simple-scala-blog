h1. The Wonders of Healthy, Well-Fed, Curvy Women

Normally I could give a damn about celebrities and, much less, people blogging about celebrities.  But "Jay":http://www.makeoutcity.com/ linked to a "side-by-side comparison":http://anise.blogspot.com/2003_12_01_anise_archive.html#107097883225825595 of Renee Zellweger with and without a little extra weight for a role and the results are staggering, at least to these eyes.  She's not normally one of the actresses I flip for, but with a good meal or two in her she looks positively luscious, radiant and glowing.  I'd reconsider my tastes for yes-I'll-have-the-cheesecake Renee.  Which I know she'll be glad to hear, international superstar playboy bachelor tastemaker that I am.

All joking aside, women out there: _eat_, please.  There's nothing more pleasing than a happy, curvy, well-fed woman (and in my experience those three traits go together!).  Turn a zaftig other cheek to societal standards and men who insist on rail-thin females.  Dessert's on me if you do.
