h1. Tonight's Show: Music That Makes Me Happy

I've been in a good mood, even after a terrible attempted DJ set last week, caused (largely) by hardware problems.  I've been happy, but that hasn't inspired me to sift through my collection and pick out anything in particular.  So, at the suggestion of a friend, these are a bunch of songs in a fairly aesthetically sensible progression that are happy and make me happy.  So enjoy, because I totally will.
