h1. Disrupting the "Power Laws" of Blogging

"Phil":http://me.creativeloafing.org and I are going to disrupt the "Power Laws of Weblogging":http://www.shirky.com/writings/powerlaw_weblog.html.  Yeah, just the two of us.  Through, uh, mutual TrackBacking and, uhm, "catchy jingles":http://me.creativeloafing.org/trackback_jingle_notsuck.mp3 [_Update: now with actual catchy jingle!_].

Seriously though, I don't think "Technorati's Interesting Newcomers":http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/interestingnewcomers.html system is going to help expose people to deep new blogs.  Link referrers are not a good way of getting to fresh ideas; a more "semantic web":http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/ probably would be.  Until then I think we're going to see lots of "ideas":http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/14/adding_more_information_to_links.html that are still rooted in people finding and rating each other, just like regular meatspace social networks.  That can be beneficial, in that there's a human BS filter, but it can also prevent exposure for people who go about things the wrong way: awkward design, lack of promotion, etc.

To a degree, people have to talk the blog talk to get noticed and accepted; our little sphere is just another clique.  But I'll bet most geeks originally found computers as an escape from such cliqueshness.  But now that they fit in somewhere, do they want more of the same, or do they want something new and challenging pushed at them?  Let's hope it's the latter.
