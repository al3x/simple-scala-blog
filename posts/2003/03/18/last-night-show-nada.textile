h1. Last Night's Show: Nada!

So yeah, I totally didn't do my usual show Monday evening.  Why?  Impending war, overwork, and yet more hardware problems (note to "Native Instruments":http://www.nativeinstruments.com: build a version of "Traktor DJ Studio":http://www.traktor-dj.com that _works_ and I'll buy it _eyeroll_).  This coming week is my spring break, so obviously no show then.  But I'm planning on whipping up some pretty sweet "mixes" in Live that, while largely pre-programmed, should flow like a fresh bottle of sumi-e ink.  Look for that action on Monday, March 31st.  Until then, fresh sounds are to be had from the stations linked to on my radio page, or "eMusic":http://www.emusic.com if you're into paying for things.
