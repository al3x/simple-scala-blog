h1. Making Music

So, hardware and software having finally come together, I'm making music.  Or at least sounds that sound good to me.  But I'm not quite sure I have anything to say, musically that is.  I have a couple ideas, things that seem neat in my head, but I'm not sure about a whole album's worth.  It's not like I've finally got the tools I need and now I'm spilling forth with creativity.  Musical ideas don't seem to come naturally so I sort of noodle around, and the results never seem that impressive or involving upon later listening.  How is it for most people?  Do they hear stuff in their heads and desperately try to get the music out, or do they coax the music out of their surroundings and instruments?  Probably both.  But which am I going/able to do, and will it sound good either way?
