h1. Musing on Emergent Democracy, Full Report To Come

I've had, for many years, a real faith in democratic power of technology.  So strong is this faith, in fact, that I'm considering making my thesis for my interdisciplinary major essentially a big picture proposal of how to use the Net to empower American voters.  But right now a number of popular technologists and sundry worldwide contributors are working on something more international and grand in scale: the "Emergent Democracy":http://joi.ito.com/static/emergentdemocracy.html manifesto (and to a lesser degree, the "Minimal Compact":http://v-2.org/displayArticle.php?article_cat=4 proposal).  When I first read both of these, in midst of an overwhelming stack of political and economic theory texts for a class, they both seemed somewhat naive and disappointing attempts to offer cutting edge technological developments as solutions to the perpetual problems of representative democracy.  I intend to read them in more depth and offer my comments both here and to the authors.  Just to let you know I'm not slacking off @^_^@
