h1. Tonight’s Show: More Random BS

I think previously themed and genred radio show is degenerating – or evolving, if you prefer it – into a DJ mix sort of deal.  Same great content, none of the fuss of categorization.  I think I’ve figured out the software/hardware thing for laptop DJing, too (though tonight’s mix will be from iTunes): use an actual goddamn DJ mixer, and just let the laptop act as glorified CD decks.  Traktor can do that, and the radio station has a mixer.  I’ll give it a go next week, but that’s not to say you won’t enjoy tonight’s selections, which properly suit a cold early spring day.
