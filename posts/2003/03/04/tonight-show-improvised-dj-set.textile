h1. Tonight's Show: Improvised DJ Set

I had a busy weekend that left me with zero time to pick a good genre-based playlist for tonight's radio show on WMBC, so to make it up to my faithful listener base _cough_ I'll be doing a live DJ set.  That's right, just me, my iBook, and Traktor pumping out the jams.  Well actually there's an audio interface and a MIDI controller there too.  But other than the first 1.5 songs I have no idea what I'm playing tonight, so it'll be mixed "on the fly," as it were.  I may update after the show with a track list, and I may not.  Catch all the info you need to listen in on the left ("radio show") and tune in!
