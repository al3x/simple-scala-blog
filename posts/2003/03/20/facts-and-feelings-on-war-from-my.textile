h1. Facts and Feelings on War From My Copyright Hero

Siva, my copyright hero, has an incredibly personal, eloquent, and moving "letter":http://www.nyu.edu/classes/siva/200012594 to those in support of war (and the Bush administration) by way of an unnamed friend.  As always, Siva is more interested in facts and actions than supporting a knee-jerk, platform response.  But he’s not afraid to communicate the anger and fear that this war and many of the US “anti-terrorist” actions have inspired.  I’ve been on the fence about this war, as both sides of the debate have been so unreasoned, noisy, and pervasive that I couldn’t get the mental space to make a decision of my own.  But this letter has finally tipped me into an anti-war camp inhabited, I believe, by the minority of people who thought long and hard about it.
