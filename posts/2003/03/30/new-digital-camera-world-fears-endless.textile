h1. New Digital Camera: World Fears Endless Pet Pics

You should prepare yourself for some occasional photoblogging henceforth, because I now have a digital camera.  I was originally thinking of something "absurdly cheap":http://www.thinkgeek.com/electronics/cameras/5c79/, but thanks to a belated post-return Christmas gift my financial options widened, and I settled on the impossibly slim "Casio Exilim EX-S2":http://exilim.casio.com/camera_specsS2M2.cfm.  It’s just lovely, and apparently is the "preferred camera":http://exilim.casio.com/reviews.cfm of Apple co-founder Steve Wozniack ^_^  I’ll try not to post any terribly mundane snaphots (pets, day-to-day activities, assassinations), just the oddball shutterbugging (shutterbuggery?).  If I ever get tired of tiny silver electronics it’s time to die.
