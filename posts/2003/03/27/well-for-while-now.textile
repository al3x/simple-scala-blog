h1. Well, For A While Now

I've been blogging for some time.  Yes, on this site.  Since roughly the inception of "Blogger":http://www.blogger.com, in fact.  It's just that I've taken periodic breaks, switched blogging engines (or wrote my own), and otherwise monkeyed with this site without regard for consistency.  That my archives only go back a few months is for the best, though, I assure you.
