h1. Screen Savers Withdrawl

I'm not much for TV beyond 24 and The Simpsons.  But, at school, the local cable company carries "TechTV":http://www.techtv.com, which is clearly god's gift to geeks everywhere.  Presently at home for break I quite miss their nightly news/product/computer help show "The Screen Savers":http://www.thescreensavers.com.  I missed TechTV all the more when I found out that resident TSS diva "Morgan Webb":http://www.morganwebb.com/ is co-hosting tonight (she usually just does a small segment of the show).  This is one of those times when TV-over-IP seems downright imperative.
