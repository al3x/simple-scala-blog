h1. I Am Quite Lame and Without Possessions

You know how I said I didn’t own any Magic: The Gathering cards?  Well, some friends got me rolling with a few cards as a belated birthday gift and pretty soon I was morally, spiritually, legally, and socially obligated to get some of my own.  I now have, albeit for not too much money (and I intend to keep it that way) several lots totaling some 2400 cards coming my way.  You’d be amazed what a little eBay sniping (of people whose shoes I’ll likely be in come two years from now) will get you.

It’ll get you 2400 Magic cards.  Just clearing that up.

It’ll be odd to have non-functional material possessions.  I have a few books and trinkets to my name but I’m not at all attached to them.  I almost never keep memorabilia, pictures, letters, or pretty much anything physical.  I have my laptop, audio outputs and other sundry peripherals, my phone, my bag, and clothing.  That’s pretty much it.  Not bragging, not proud (it’s kind of odd, actually), it’s just the way I’ve come to live after years of shuttling between parents, expecting to run away to places far away, and college (in that order).  A bunch of dead-tree cards sitting about, needing to be ordered and shuffled and contained and all those terribly _corporeal_ things will be strange for me.
