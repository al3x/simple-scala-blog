h1. Big Ideas

  Don't get any big ideas
  they're not gonna happen
  You paint your house white
  and feel the noise
  but there'll be something missing
  Just when you've found it, it's gone
  Just when you feel it, you don't
  It's gone forever
  She stands stark naked
  and she beckons you to bed
  Don't go
  you'll only want to come back again
  Don't get any big ideas
  they're not going to happen
  You'll go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking
  Just when you've found it, it's gone
  Just when you feel it, you don't
  It's gone forever
