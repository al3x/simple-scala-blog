h1. Phreaknic Is Where I Am

Drove all night (my hands clearly wet on the wheel despite not having a thing we/they/you call “radar love”) to Nashville with some mates for "Phreaknic 7":http://www.phreaknic.info/, which beings quite shortly.  I’ll be rocking the collaborative note-taking, as I did at ToorCon.  Haven’t seen any of Nashville yet.  Don’t really intend to.  Here until Sunday.  Very very tired.
