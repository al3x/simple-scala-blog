h1. The Magnetic Fields Cover is Perfection

  This is not love.
  This is not even worth a point of view.
  In Echo park I
  pause for effect and whisper "who are you?"
  They crawl out of their holes for me,
  and I die: you die.
  Hear them laugh, watch them turn on me.
  And I die: you die.
  See my scars, they call me such things.
  Tear me, tear me, tear me.
  But I have your names,
  screaming "you will suffer" and "you're all too late."
  Now I feel young.
  Does everything stop when the old dame fails?
  They crawl out of their holes for me,
  And I die: you die.
  Hear them laugh, watch them turn on me.
  And I die: you die.
  See my scars, they call me such things.
  Tear me, tear me, tear me.
  But I'm still frightened by the telephone.
