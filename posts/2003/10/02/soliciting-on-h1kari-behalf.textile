h1. Soliciting on h1kari’s Behalf

The most excellent organizer of ToorCon, "h1kari":http://www.dachb0den.com/users/h1kari.html, is looking for crash space or other expense-reducing factors to facilitate his attendance of the "WowGao":http://www.wowgao.com/ conference in Toronto.  If you can help a brother out, he’s got free passes to an otherwise $1000 conference.  Give the man a holler, ideally on #suid on irc."suidnet.org":http://www.suidnet.org/."
