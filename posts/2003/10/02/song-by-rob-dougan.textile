h1. "Drinking Song" by Rob Dougan

  I want to weave a musical spell
  that leaves you unwell and thinking of me every day.
  I want to play you a tune that leaves you marooned and troubled
  each time I'm away.
  Is there a melody that could lead you to me like a lullabied child lead to sleep?
  So for one moment in time you'd find that you're mine,
  and softly I'd kiss you and weep.
  I want to write a simple song that's so frequently sung
  that you call me to have the thing banned.
  Who's charm so endears that whole nations cheer and sigh
  when you take my hand.
  Is there a melody that could lead you to me like a lullabied child lead to sleep?
  So for one moment in time you'd find that you're mine,
  and softly I'd kiss you and weep.
  For I'm a gambler that just wants to lose and be allowed to leave.
  I'm a traveller: with one last mile my journey is complete.
  I'm like a swallow that wants one long last look before flying east.
  Last on my list - and then I quit - to kiss your lips and weep.
  I want to play a silver note that fills you with hope
  and tames you to feed from my hand.
  A turquoise chord that invites you to soar
  and fly to a faraway land.
  A symphony that gently leads you to sit and be still with me.
  And grief doesn't frighten me,
  at it's worst it delights me,
  'cause I want to kiss you and weep.
  For I'm a gambler that just wants to lose and be allowed to leave.
  I'm a traveller: with one last mile my journey is complete.
  I'm like a swallow that wants one long last look before flying east.
  Last on my list - and then I quit - to kiss your lips and weep.
  So for one moment in time you'd find that you're mine,
  and softly I'd kiss you and weep.

And speaking of weeping: join us at the "Cry Fest" Cure vs Smiths dance party this Saturday night at the "Black Cat":http://www.blackcatdc.com/, won't you?
