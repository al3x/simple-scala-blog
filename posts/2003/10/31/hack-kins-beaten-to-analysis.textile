h1. Hack-kins: Beaten To The Analysis

Salon has a fine "article":http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/10/30/low_carb_hackers/ on why so many techies are doing Atkins and other low-carb diets.  The observation that it has the thrill of “hacking your metabolism” is one I noted to myself some time ago.  The article makes me think I should go whole hog (no pun intended) and try to shed the few extra pounds I’ve got sitting about the middle via full-on ketosis.
