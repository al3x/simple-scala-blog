h1. Where Shallowness Gets You

So "Jon":http://iheartmena.typepad.com/ and I go talking shit about bloggers being ugly and now there's a "contest":http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/2003/10/05.html#a945 to prove and judge our respective beauty.  The blog community sure horsewhips its dunces quick, don't it?

By way of explanation, by backing Jon up I didn't mean to imply that _I_ was beautiful, merely that everybody ever presented in a meatspace public forum to represent a community should be.  I mean, c'mon, we don't want to be unreasonable or shallow, right?

That said, what scale of beauty is this contest using?  I'm a big fan of the "Steve Buscemi -&gt; Halle Barry/1-10," on which I'd say I rate a solid 6, maybe a 6.5 in nice slacks.

My best to the winner, who'd have to know the al3x reeeeaaaaaal well to find some ancient photos of me with a compromising haircolor that I believe are still online but would never be found via Google Images or anything of the search engine ilk.  Cory Doctorow has a shot or two of me in his ToorCon 2003 gallery in which I manage to look both shiny and pallid, the dualistic cosmetic gift of combined English and German stock.  Other than those I don't think there are too many more images of me on the Interweb that you can get to without an AdultCheck ID.. err… I mean…  Crap, I've said too much.

I still think all y'all are old and white as all hell, though.  Even if I'm not pretty.
