h1. We Have A Winner

The ever-charming Rogers Cadenhead has decided at my portion of the me/Jon Gales weblogger beauty contest, and my mate Scott's photo of he and I in a State College, PA Hooters restaurant is "the winner":http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/stories/2003/10/14/weblogger-beauty-contest-winner.html.  Frankly, I couldn't be more delighted by the choice of winning photo, or by Cadenhead's commentary.  To be fair, though, I wasn't recoiling: both Scott and I happened to blink when the photo was taken.  But I was a little timid about the whole ordeal, that much is correct.  I great a huge laugh out of the whole thing.  Kudos, Cadenhead.

And man, what the devil was I thinking with that red hair back in the cyberpunk teen years?
