h1. To Be Old, White, and At BloggerCon

Just as I was thinking that "the people":http://www.bricklin.com/ALBUMS/bloggercon2003/ at "BloggerCon":http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/ seemed almost exclusively old and white, Jon "points out that they’re ugly":http://iheartmena.typepad.com/weblog/2003/10/bloggers_are_ug.html#comments, too.  Harsh but true.  And are those assessments just jealous, bitter lashings-out from two young-ish bloggers who float around the second or third strata of the blogosphere?  Enh, maybe, but I could really give a rat’s ass about the con’s "lame":http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/day1/grid "content":http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/day2/grid.

Normally I’m not nearly so multiculti or pro-young people, but a lack of youth and minorities in a forum on blogging just seems to be totally missing the point.  I’d love to see speakers extolling the empowering nature of blogging and online journalism, champion technologies of those without a voice in the “real world,” to a bunch of upper-middle class white people.  Oh, no, wait, no I wouldn’t.

Apologies for the adolescent vitriol, but I’m only in my teens for 4.5 more days so I’ve gotta get it all out now.  Still: the ironing, as they say, is delicious.  (And, I just notice when posting this, the ironing "does not escape the Gwai Lo":http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/28746#563644).
