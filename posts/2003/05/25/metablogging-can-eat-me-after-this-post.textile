h1. Metablogging Can Eat Me (After This Post)

Seems like the same bloggers who talk endlessly about the transformative power of blog-journalism don't talk about much more than the blog scene itself ("case in point":http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001043.shtml).  Reality check: blogs aren't cool, cool ideas are cool.  Blogs just happen to be the means to get those ideas out there, and I'm pretty damn sick of medium-as-message.  Wanna transform the nature of journalism and information dissemination?  Write about something other than blogging!  This is but a small part of my increasing boredom with the pervasive tech-for-the-sake-of-tech attitude of much of the digerati.  More on that later.
