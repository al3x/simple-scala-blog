h1. LJ from JWZ (on the DL?)

"jwz":http://www.jwz.org was nice enough to give me a LiveJournal invite code after reading my "Adbusters rant":http://www.al3x.net/mt/archives/000152.html, so now I "have one":http://www.livejournal.com/users/al3xpayne/.  Not sure what I'd use it for, save posting comments on other people's LJs, but what the hell.  Would you refuse an invitation from jwz?  No sir, you would not.
