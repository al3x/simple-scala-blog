h1. Been A Long, Long Time Gone

My first year of college?  Check.  Put the nail in that coffin about midnight Tuesday when I zapped my final end-of-term essay to my prof for an economics/law/political philosophy seminar called “What Should Government Do?”  It was my favorite course this semester, and hopefully an opportunity that will continue to be available to Freshman as part of UMBC’s “First Year Seminar.”  I may actually be a research/teaching assistant for another prof teaching a rather neat FYS this coming Fall semester, but I’ll wait until the details are concrete before posting any more on that.

But it’s so, so nice to be done.  As much as I’ve enjoyed this first year, it’s been odd not shirking my work to read (non-assigned books) voraciously, as I did throughout most of my education thusfar.  College has actually been engaging enough to warrant _staying on task_, and that’s a total first.  But, that said, there’s been so much I simply haven’t had the time and energy to do after attending to my studies (like blogging for about the past week), and now I have the time to do them.  At least until summer school starts…
