h1. Summer Session In Full Swing

As per the title, summer session is in full swing.  I’ve got about seven more weeks of Spanish 101 and Biology 100, only the first of which I’m enjoying.  Spanish is a colorful, satisfying language to speak; you get to open your mouth wide, roll your r’s, and generally be linguistically flamboyant, at least compared to English.  The downside of summer session is that all the things I wanted/intended to do with all my “summer free time” have now gone back to the backburner (rebackburned?).  But I do intend to get the Adjective Records site up and operational, if not its e-commerce components.  Hopefully I can track down a job for the second half of summer, too.  It’s all very odd, though, as the weather in DC/Baltimore feels like early spring, summer activities thus seeming utterly un-apropos.
