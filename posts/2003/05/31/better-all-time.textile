h1. Better All The Time

"Emusic":http://www.emusic.com just keeps getting better and better as more labels join up.  Iâ€™ve got so much new legit music to feed my ears with its practically audio gluttony.  Two things that made me jump for joy: tons of Pixies, and tons of Gary Numan.  All this, of course, with plenty of Mille Plateaux, Force Inc, m3rck, etc etc for the techheads.  And a new download manager!  Oh Emusic, will you marry me?
