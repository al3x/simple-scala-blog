h1. Matrix Tickets

Jon @ n3rd.net "says":http://n3rd.net/weblog.php:  "I bought my ticket to go see Matrix Reloaded. This Wednesday at 10PM EST I'll be where most everyone else wants to be. And yes, I know it comes out Thursday. God bless AMC."  Ditto here, save my movie ticket god to be blessed is the mighty and powerful Muvico.  It will be a welcome respite from end-of-semester hell, for which there is no god to pray to that I am aware of.
