h1. Best Album Title Ever

I've always been one for creative and amusing album titles (and band names, for that matter).  I think, when exploring the discography of an artist I'm really into at the moment, I found my personal favorite to date: ""A Giant Alien Force More Violent &amp; Sick Than Anything You Can Imagine"":http://www.klangstabil.com/hymen/all/y405.html by Venetian Snares ("review":http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/v/venetian-snares/a-giant-alien-force-more-violent-and-sick-than-anything-you-can-imagine.shtml).  The album just happens to come in "really cool packaging":http://www.klangstabil.com/hymen/all/y405-packaging-xs.jpg.
