h1. Live Experimental Audio Tonight

Myself and Adjective Records co-founder "5dots":http://www.5dots.net will be playing at the "Black Cat":http://www.blackcatdc.com here in DC this evening.  Far from getting our own gig, we're just playing short sets at the free-for-all "Open Minijax" event organized by Derek Morton (of the "Mikronytes":http://www.mikronytes.com), part of his "Tech Club":http://www.mikroknytes.com/techclub/ series of electronic audio happenings.  Barring any logistical or technical disasters, I should be playing a good 15 minutes of synthesized and resampled drones melded with intercepted Russian spy transmissions off my iBook.  Good family fun.
If you'd like to say "die," stop by and do so, it's only $5.  I'll be the dorkus with the iBook and spikey hair in a black t-shirt.  Err, one of about twenty.  God bless the post-techno scene.
