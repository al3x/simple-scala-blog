h1. Live Performance: Fun

That went well.  The crowd of roughly 40 was certainly the most people I've ever played my own music for, though fewer than I've DJed for.  I couldn't see into the darkness of the crowd from the dimly lit stage and the fog of laptop glare, but apparently I didn't drive anyone from the performance space.  Friends said the set was good and I got a couple approving nods and thumbs-up from random attendees, performers and listeners alike.  Labelmate and comrade 5dots preceded me with a bruttally aryhmtic and deliciously noisy set.  Other performers there varied in skill and style and a couple (who's names I can't recall, but will attempt to find out) stood out.  None were so appealing, however, as to approach them for potential work with our fledgling label.  On the whole it was a fun evening, both as listener and performer; live performance is something I'll have to pursue in the future.  My set, straight off the ones-and-zeros, will be made available ASAP on the presently under-construction Adjective Records website.
