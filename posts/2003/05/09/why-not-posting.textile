h1. Why The Not Posting?

It’s not like I don’t have things to say, I’m just too busy to say them.  And it sure didn’t help that some badly-written C for a computer science class b0rked my computer pretty good.  All languages should do automatic memory management (oh yeah, I know, don’t blame the tools, blame the programmer – blame is squarely on me, I assure you).  One too many malloc()’s gone awry, looped a couple hundred times, does odd things, even to %(=caps)OS X%.  Backed up to the iPod, reinstalled, things are fine.  Very burnt out, and still about another week of school to go.

Well, keep yourself amused with Warren Ellis’s fantastic blog "Die Puny Humans":http://www.diepunyhumans.com.  It felt like a more genuine, down-to-earth BoingBoing until today’s discussion of “social software” _cough_ bullshit _cough_, but most of the time it’s just neat crap.  More when my optic nerves aren’t actively trying to beat the rest of my brain into submission.
