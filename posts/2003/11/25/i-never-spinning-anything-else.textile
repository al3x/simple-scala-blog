h1. I’m Never Spinning Anything Else

I proclaim the dancefloor stormer of the winter season to be _not_ “The Illness,” the proclaimed single off "Kid606":http://www.brainwashed.com/kid606/’s latest _Kill Sound Before Sound Kills You_, but rather single B-side “Ecstasy Motherfucker.”  The majority of the new album is the sort of crazed jungle-cum-gabber that the Kid treated us to on his last tour through Baltimore and this track is no exception.  Dominated by a fierce, schizophrenic beat, knowingly hackneyed samples (a voice at the end proclaims, “I *am* a cliche), and 303 acid-style tweakings somehow made new and fun, it’s hard for any electronic music fan not to find something to smile about whilst shaking their head/ass/groove thang.  I am elated that I’ve got a copy of this beast on vinyl.  You suckas are never hearing anything else.
