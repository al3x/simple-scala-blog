h1. Content I'll Glady Pay For and, Disturbingly Related, Guns

Definitely just picked up a month "Suicide Girls":http://www.suicidegirls.com/ membership.  And damned but if I still don't have _such_ a weakness for punk/goth/quirky-lookin' girls.  Between that and the gun fetish apparently lying dormant in me awakened by the image of Trinity with a "firearm":http://madogre.com/Interviews/Guns_of_the_Matrix.htm to the Merovingian's head in _The Matrix Revolutions_ last Wednesday I'd say my kinks are just asking for trouble.  Punk girls with guns?  If _Tank Girl_ taught me anything, that's bad news.  Shit gets blowed up [sic].

(And yes, I can hear the shudders, winces, and pleas of my regular readers to never, ever, ever again explore my sexuality in blog form ever again, at all, ever.  Sorry.)
