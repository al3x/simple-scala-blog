h1. Krav Maga?

I've been eager to take up a martial art for some time, and the Israeli military hand-to-hand combat form Krav Maga came with high recommendation.  "Krav Maga DC":http://kravmagadc.com/ has an open house tomorrow (er, later today) and I'm gonna check it out with "Phil":http://www.timeporn.net/, who can't be bothered to update his blog because he's recently been made God's personal IT subcontractor but totally lied about being able to build a relational soul-management database with a .NET front-end in 24.5 seconds and is now paying for it mightily.  No shit.

I'll tell you how the Krav Maga intro went, you lucky dog.  Hope you and yours are having a good extended Thanksgiving weekend.  Or, if you're extra-US, hope you're enjoying not living under a regime of utterly mind-boggling stupidity.  Oh wait.  Fuck.  Just have a good weekend.
