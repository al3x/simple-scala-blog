h1. Home For the Holiday: Fill My Dancecard

I'm back in Bethesda through Sunday.  If you're a friend or well-wisher with an interest in the experience of "hanging out" with me, but are normally turned off of the prospect by the crime, stench, and distant location of Baltimore, this is a golden opportunity you'd be well advised not to pass up.  Friday and Saturday are looking good, though "A-to-the-zee-eye-zeez":http://musicismyreligion.blogspot.com/ is guaranteed a slice sometime Saturday.  But still, there are literally _hours_ of my time on the table here.  Don't let this chance pass you by.

Hit me up.  Holla at'cha boy.  Et cetera.
