h1. So That's Who's Responsible

I've been fascinated and disturbed by the covers of several of "Venetian Snares":http://www.discogs.com/artist/Venetian_Snares' recent albums: "Find Candace":http://www.pileup.com/babyart/candace.htm, "Winter In The Belly of a Snake":http://www.pileup.com/babyart/winterinthebellyofasnake.htm, and "Doll Doll Doll":http://www.pileup.com/babyart/dolldolldoll.htm.  As it turns out, all three are by Trevor Brown, whose online portfolio "Baby Art":http://www.pileup.com/babyart/_top.htm is not for the faint of heart.  I'm serious.  Don't click around if you're unsettled by mutilated children, brutal sexual imagery, or any of the usual "extreme" subject matters that noise artists seem to relish for their album art.  That said, my favorite pieces are "Pretty Hate Machine":http://www.pileup.com/babyart/phm.htm, this "magazine cover":http://www.pileup.com/babyart/suture.htm, and this "CD cover":http://www.pileup.com/babyart/emfa.htm.  Favorite here meaning "piqued and repulsed by," not necessarily "eager to go out and seek or emulate in the world."  You get the idea.  It's good sick stuff.
