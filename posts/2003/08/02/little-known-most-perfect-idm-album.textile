h1. Little-Known Most Perfect IDM Album

""Triskaideka" ":http://www.discogs.com/release/1944 by Syndrone is my hands-down favorite quirky techno (or IDM, if you must) album.  Yes, that's right: above Autechre, Boards of Canada, all that lot.  They may have style and sheen, but Syndrone bleeds emotion through his/her/its mess of glitch, distant pads, 8-bit melodies, and bass burbles.  If you're dry-eyed by the end of "Intrn|rrr" either you don't get electronic music or someone turned off your emotion chip.  There's just something that aches from behind what would otherwise be a fairly formulaic combination of sounds.  Sometimes it's sad, sometimes beautiful, and often both.

Find it where I did, on "eMusic":http://www.emusic.com/cd/10605/10605391.html.  I didn't realize they describe it as "aching" on their page too until I went to find that link, but there you go.  Not just me.
