h1. Oh Thank Christ

MacNN "reports":http://www.macnn.com/news/20783 that bash is now the default terminal shell in developer preview builds of the next version of Apple's Mac OS X, version 10.3 (code named "Panther").  This means I'll save literally _minutes_ switching the default shell in the NetInfo Manager every time I set up an OS X machine.  I mean, I understand OpenBSD using plain old featureless 'sh' for security purposes, but tcsh (the previous OS X default shell) is just awkward for no good goddamn reason.  bash is easy, bash is featureliscious, and bash is the growing *nix de facto standard these days, despite holdovers in the *BSD world.  Good move, Panther team.
