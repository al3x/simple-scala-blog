h1. False Advertising

As of yesterday I live in an apartment-cum-dorm, complete with kitchen.  I like to cook, and cook pretty well, but rarely had occasion to at home and had no kitchen in my dorm last year.  But now, kitchen, and cooking ensues.  That means recipes, so I Googled and found a few nice sites.  And a few unusual ones.

But "cooking with monkey!":http://www.himonkey.net/cooking/ is flagrant false advertising.  What the hell am I going to do with all this monkey?!  It doesnâ€™t come cheap, people.
