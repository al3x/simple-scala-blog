h1. Putting the T&A in Move-In Day?

"This post":http://www.theward.net/archives/2003_08.html#000401 (link courtesy of "je'":http://www.makeoutcity.com/) on checking out girls on campus move-in day certainly rings relevant, if mildly appalling in its sleaziness.

I move back to UMBC for my sophomore year this coming Sunday.  It's going to be bizarre for me to do the college social thing.  I never really got to know anyone too well during my freshman year, and I certainly never "checked out the prospects," committed as I was to what I then assumed to be a longer-than-long-term relationship.  I regret not making more friends on campus, but I still find the idea of on-campus dating odd (if anyone actually "dates," that is: it seems like college kids just pursue belt-notch fucks).  I'm going to make an effort to be more social, but it's going to have to be a _very_ conscious effort.

Maybe I'm inexplicably old-fashioned.  Maybe I already feel like I've sown my wild oats, and drunken sex with a half-unconscious sorority girl on a plastic single extra-long in a 6Ã—6' dorm room doesn't sound like an inroad to self discovery, much less pleasure.  Maybe I'm too judgmental, too full of presuppositions, too quick to dismiss people for the social setting in which I meet them.  Maybe I need to loosen the fuck up if I'm going to enjoy this year back at school.
