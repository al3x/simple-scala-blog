h1. RSS Rolling Stoned?

So, searching for a complete Timbaland "discography":http://www.ohhla.com/YFA_timb.html, I came across "his page on RollingStone.com":http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/default.asp?oid=6884 and noted that they offer RSS feeds, both per-artist and for their news updates.  It's pretty crazy that RSS has gotten that large, even if Rolling Stone's content is less than engaging.  Pretty soon we're gonna have Dive Winer singing "Mo' Publicity Mo' Problems" while Sam Ruby spits battle rhymes.  Or maybe I need to quit listening to hip-hop when I blog.
