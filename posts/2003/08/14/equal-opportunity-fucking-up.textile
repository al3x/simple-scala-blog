h1. Equal Opportunity Fucking Up

You better believe I’m even-handed with the InfoSec criticism: the GNU project has been "0wned":http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-21.html *since March*, and that’s a goddamn travesty.  Security is security, whether source is closed or open.  Open _should_ mean better security, though an productive and security-minded open development environment requires people to get involved and speak up about security flaws.  At any rate, I’ve got just as little patience for this as for the whole Blaster worm thing.  C’mon people.
