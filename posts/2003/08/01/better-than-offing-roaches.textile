h1. Better Than Offing Roaches

The "program":http://www.ece.cmu.edu/c3s/raid2003/program.html for this year's Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection (RAID) conference looks mighty interesting, and student registration is a fairly reasonable $150 (hear that O'Reilly?!  You'd get my business at that price, but find me a "student" who can afford $600 conference passes!).  A trip to Pittsburgh may just be in my future.
