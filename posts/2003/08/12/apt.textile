Got the iTunes shuffling through my library and up comes "Can't Stop Won't Stop" by the Young Gunz, a one-beat props rhyme homage to being large and have a popular record label.  Perfectly apt, the next random track is "Why Hip-Hop Sucks in '96" by DJ Shadow, in which a cheesy parody of a commercial rap song beat gives way to a smarmy voice proclaiming "it's the money!"
I think iTunes is trying to tell me something.
