h1. Clarification

I want to make clear that I'm not a "copyfighter," per se.  At least, not to the extent that my ivy league bloggelganger "Derek":http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/cmusings/ is, or Big Mama Copyfight "Donna Wentworth":http://www.copyfight.org/.  My interest in the subject comes by way of my focus on eGovernment.  I'm more interested in how technology can aid government than how government can undermine technology.  Of course, the two go hand in hand, and hence those copyfight issues come up from time to time.  But at the end of the day, when discussing intellectual property in the digital age, I'm just another guy with an opinion (and a few primary sources incidentally close to mind).  So, as a non-pro, it's flattering that people are giving a damn about what I've got to say.
