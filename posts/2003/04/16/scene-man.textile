h1. The Scene, Man

The experimental electronic music scene around DC/MD/VA owes a lot to a select few.  I had the privledge of meeting Derek Morton, definitely select amongst the few, and member of longtime personal favorite local act "Microknytes":http://www.mikroknytes.com/.  Turns out he's putting together a "series of happenings":http://www.mikroknytes.com/techclub/, if you'll excuse the term, that are sort of themed "open amp nights" for local experimentalists.  The first, "Open Minijax," is strictly for performances involving portable audio devices that have a minijack (1/8" headphone) output.  I'm gonna go represent the iBook contingent.  Good timing, too, as two days later the label cohorts and I will be truckin' on up to "Mutek":http://www.mutek.ca/ in Montreal.  For more immediate experimental gratification, check out Baltimore's own "Once.Twice Festival":http://www.oncetwicesound.com/festival/ this Thursday through Sunday.  I'll be at all of it, barring disaster.
