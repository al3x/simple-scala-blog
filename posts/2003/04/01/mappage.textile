I’ve been added to the "DC Metro Area Blog Map":http://www.reenhead.com/map/metroblogmap.html (at Friendship Heights, as it’s closer to my home than Bethesda). You’d think people on this crazy Interweb of ours wouldn’t care so much for physical space relations, but there you go.  It’s nice to know who’s nearby.  Thanks, "‘reen":http://www.reenhead.com/.
