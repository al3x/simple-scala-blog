h1. On The Market

Looks like my blog was finally re-indexed by the Blogshares bot, and is now "available to trade":http://www.blogshares.com/blogs.php?blog=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.al3x.net%2F.  Apparently its P/E (a rough valuation of the stockâ€™s worth relative to the market) is in perfect alignment at 1.0.  The worth of all the stock is a healthy enough $1,167.67, and shares are presently $0.23.  Get in on the ground floor people.
