I think it’s pretty funny that the person(s) who "owned Madonna’s site":http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/madonnasplash1.html took the time to propose to "TechTV":http://www.techtv.com hottie "Morgan Webb":http://www.morganwebb.com.  I think I know how to propose to my femme someday (“Oh sweetie, you rooted "darpa.mil":http://www.darpa.mil for me!  How can I say no?”).
