h1. The Convienience of Poverty

The upshot of hardly earning a damn thing is not having to pay federal and state taxes on it.  The downside is, well, being broke (he says after discussion of digital camera cases).  But I was shocked when looking up tax-related at "IRS.gov":http://www.irs.gov: the site is a close to usable as I think anything IRS-related could possibly be.  Almost makes me wish I __was__ paying taxes just to try out their "multitude":http://www.irs.gov/efile/lists/0,,id=101223,00.html of electronic filing services ("free":http://www.irs.gov/app/freeFile/jsp/index.jsp if you're down at the heels!).  Almost.
