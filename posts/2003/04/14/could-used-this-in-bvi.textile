h1. Could’ve Used This in BVI

As found on "BoingBoing":http://boingboing.net/: “Casio Japan has "released":http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/urltrurl?lp=ja_en&amp;url=http://www.casio.co.jp/release/2003/ex_ws2.html a waterproof external case for its Exilim [digital] cameras.”  I’m loving my EX-S2, for which I recently tracked down a leather case from a Japanese eBayer, as cases are utterly unavailable in the US.  I’m no Ansel Adams (nor, disappointingly, even a "Charles Addams":http://www.toonopedia.com/addams.htm), but this camera has served me well for snapshots and small movies over the past few weeks.

I hadn’t exactly been planning on carrying a camera everywhere and snapping whatever I found interesting, but the tiny size of the Exilim lets you keep it in a pocket and forget about it until you come across a scene of overwhelming everyday “American Beauty”-style beauty.  Which, if your standards are as a low a paper bag blowing about in the wind, happens about sixteen times a day.  But, back to the point, I really could’ve used an underwater digital camera in the British Virgin Islands this past winter break.  I saw some lovely fish that I just know would’ve been happier knowing their portraits were captured in two megapixel glory.
