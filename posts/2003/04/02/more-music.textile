h1. More Music

Trying to make up for the lack of music posts I guess.  Listen to “69 Love Songs” by "The Magnetic Fields":http://www.houseoftomorrow.com/tmf.php if you’ve ever tuned into your local public radio station when they’re playing _really_ old country music and kinda dug it.  Rich vocals, sweet nothing verses, and banjos.  Makes me happy…
