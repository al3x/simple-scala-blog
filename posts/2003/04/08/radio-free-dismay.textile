h1. Radio Free Dismay

The mix went quite well, but hardly anyone was listening.  Three people tuned in for the later few minutes on UMBC's "mid-fi" MP3 stream (the hi-fi stream being perpetually broken, like most of the radio station's equipment and space).  I put quite a bit of time, even money if you count hardware, into the show, and I feel like I'm getting very little out of it.  The people running our campus radio station, WMBC, are all talk when it comes to getting more exposure for the station.  I'd do that work myself, but as it is the time I spend preparing my sets is time I should be working on school stuff.

So hardly anyone knows about the station, much less my show, and that's not great.  But it's been since last semester that I had anyone say that they were introduced to music they found interesting by my show, and that's what bugs me more than anything.  I think, as far as generating exposure for the artists I like, I'd be better off doing mixes and announcing/releasing them over this site.

*UPDATE:* and that's exactly what I've decided to do.  No more radio show, barring WMBC getting their collective shit together, and expect bimonthly mixes released here in MP3, probably encoded at 96 to keep the file size (and thus my bandwidth expenses) down.   I may, in fact, attempt to replicate the rather good mix I did tonight for starters.  Thoughts on this decision are appreciated.
