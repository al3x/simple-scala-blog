h1. Listed, Trading, and Rolling (Again)

Got myself all registered and, soon, "indexed":http://www.blogshares.com/blogs.php?blog=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.al3x.net%2F on BlogShares.  It’s a neat idea: a stock market for weblogs, where the worth of each blog is determined by how many people link to it and how much those linkers are worth.  Obviously this site here "isn’t worth much":http://www.blogshares.com/blogs.php?blog=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.al3x.net%2F yet.  You famous bloggers need to either link me or buy some shares.  Preferably both.  I’ve already bought shares in some of my favorite reads.  Unrelated: the blogroll has been updated.  Some stuff dropped, a bunch of stuff added.  I use a slightly tweaked version of "Jeremy Zawodny’s opml2html":http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/000386.html perl script to convert my exported list of NetNewsWire feeds to a bunch of %(=caps)HTML% list items I can slap right into my blog template.
