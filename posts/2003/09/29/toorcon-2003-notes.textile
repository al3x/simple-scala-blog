h1. ToorCon 2003 Notes

I’ll write more about the con when I’m home tomorrow, but now that I’ve got mad net connectivity here at "Dachb0den":http://www.dachb0den.com/ it seems a good time to share the collaborative notes on the conference that I and several other Rendezvous-enabled attendees took.  So right here, exclusive, and in plain old readable %(=caps)ASCII%, are:

* "Day One":http://www.al3x.net/toorcon2003day1.txt
* "Day Two":http://www.al3x.net/toorcon2003day2.txt

We got quite a few of the talks and took some pretty damn good notes.  Read, learn, wish you had been there.  Sucka.
