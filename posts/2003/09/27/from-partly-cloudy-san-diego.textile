h1. From Partly Cloudy San Diego

Uneventful flights over to the Left Coat, now presently hanging out in a Starbucks (they have them here, you'll love them), sipping a Jamba Juice (ditto), surfing this "wireless Interweb" I keep hearing so much about.

Sorry for not writing more but school and "conference":http://www.toorcon.org/ prep have kept me mad busy.  When people Google me during my talk tomorrow and find this site (a search for "Alexander Payne" produces this site before the director of my same name) they're gonna think I'm some sorry emo LiveJournal kid from the past few posts.  But by pointing this out I've theoretically staved off any blog-related heckles from conference attendees (save, I'm told firsthand, from my co-presenter "Phil)":http://www.timeporn.net/.

So yeah, all seems go for the talk except for some Compact Flash media that's freaking out on me.  If anyone knows of a good computer shop in downtown San Diego it'd be pretty nice of you to hit me up on AIM or email before, say, 7pm PST.
