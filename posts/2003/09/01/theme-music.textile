h1. Theme Music

Inspired, as I recall, by a Family Guy bit, I've been asking friends and well-wishers what they would choose as their theme music.  That is, if they were always played into the room by an omnipresent orchestra who can cover everything in the celestial jukebox, what sounds would best compliment them?  Answers have ranged from the kneejerk, obvious "Theme to Shaft" to Sousa marches.  People are funny.

My personal preference is for ""Because I Got It Like That"":http://www.musicsonglyrics.com/J/Jungle%20Brothers/Jungle%20Brothers%20-%20Because%20I%20Got%20It%20Like%20That%20lyrics.htm by the Jungle Brothers, and I stand by that.  An acceptable backup would be ""Big Ole Butt" ":http://www.ighetto.com/~daveslyrics/LLCoolJ/WalkingWithThePanther/BigOleButt.html by Ladies Love Cool James.  Because, while I said I'd be true, it is undeniable that Tina got a big ole' butt, and, ergo, I'm leaving you.  Well, not _you_, because you understand that it would be perfect theme music to have on hand for certain events.  Of course you do.

*Update:* upon further consideration, I would also accept ""Deacon Blues"":http://www.leoslyrics.com/listlyrics.php?id=1882 by Steely Dan.  Verses, chorus, or just the sax solo, whichever.  I'm not picky.
