A while back I "linked":http://www.al3x.net/mt/archives/000042.html to a handful of cocktail recipe sites that I came across in my search for good Painkiller proportions.  One of them was mixed-drink.com, a fine enough site but hardly a boozer's digital paradise.  I've thought little of it until this afternoon, when I received this email:

bq. Hello:
I noticed that you linked to mixed-drink.com from your website. I thought that you might be very interested in a website my company just developed called BarTV.com which features cocktail recipes, bartending tips and tricks as well as articles about cocktail culture. When you get a chance, please visit the site and consider linking to it.
"http://www.bartv.com":http://www.bartv.com â€“ dedicated to liquid.
Sincerely,
Bill Litfin

Clearly, Mr. Litfin, I have no problem at all with linking your site.  In fact, your site is so good that I'll overlook what was, essentially, unsolicited commercial email and flat out _recommend_ your site.  Sloshy readers: this is a damn fine site for all things cocktail.  It is well designed (despite using Flash), stylish, and chock full of lush-favorable content.  My "associates":http://www.acesulfamek.com and I deem it good.  Drink up.
