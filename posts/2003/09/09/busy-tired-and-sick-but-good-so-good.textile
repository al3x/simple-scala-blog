h1. Busy Tired and Sick But Good So Good

It’s been a busy, sleepless weekend of geekdom, parties, the semesterly "Linux Installfest":http://userpages.umbc.edu/~randy/umbc-installfest/Fall2003/index.html, and learning how to have (male) friends again.  I haven’t written, haven’t felt like writing, and really don’t have anything much to write now.  I’ll explain away my absences if I damn well please.  Oh, add pining to the list of activities.  It’s not as bad when I keep myself busy, but if I stop for a minute I think of her.  So I’ve kept myself going and now I’m a little sick.

I’ve decided that I would like a girl who will, amongst other things, make love with me while the new Deftones album plays, particularly "Lucky You":http://www.thedeftones.com/deftoneslyrics.shtml#luckyou.  I was skeptical myself, but it’s a damn fine album.  But the issue at hand:  any takers?  I need a sacrifice, or you’ll never get anything but personal posts again.
