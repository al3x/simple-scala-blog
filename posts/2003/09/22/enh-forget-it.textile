h1. Enh, Forget It

I'm going to take a cue from the "big 5":http://www.5dots.net/ and not bother with this whole silly lyrical mix thing.  It's like half past getting-the-fuck-over-it o'clock as it is.  No need to make y'all suffer through a bunch of lyrics you won't read in full anyway.  And I think all the stuff I've been listening to has been blogged here before.  Consider yourselves spared.
