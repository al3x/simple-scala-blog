h1. The Grossest of Food Combinations.

That's right, I'm back from the dead and all I've got to talk about is gross food combinations.  Honest to god, though, back from the dead.  Rein-fucking-carnated.  It's been busy.

Anyway.  The reigning gross food combo champion, suggested by my stepbrother, has been "shrimp "s'mores":http://food.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=15304," a true culinary abomination.  But this evening saw a very competitive entry to the gastric assault brainstorm: a ""Funyun":http://www.fritolay.com/consumer/funfoods/products/funyuns.html and "Dr Pepper":http://www.drpepper.com/dp/html/index.html smoothie."

Further suggestions encouraged.  Do not share recipes with nations and nation-states we have standing weapons-sales bans upon.  Regardless of where you're from.
