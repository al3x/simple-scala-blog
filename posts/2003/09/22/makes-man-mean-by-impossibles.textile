h1. “Gin Makes a Man Mean” by The Impossibles

oh she thinks I mean nothing at all but sometimes it’s like a kick in the shin.
she’s insecticide to a bug like me but I just can’t take it if I just can’t win.
oh yeah she treats me like a gum disease, I’ve got half a mind to tell her so,
but she still does what she pleases,
I gotta pull away before she lets me go.
I’m gonna wash that girl right outta my hair, wash that girl right outta my hair,
I’m gonna wash that girl right outta my hair.
Oh she’s just like a cavity that hurts but I poke at it anyway,
it’s an acquired taste I guess, but I have trouble thinking any other way.
oh yeah she treats me like a gum disease, I’ve got half a mind to tell her so,
but she still does what she pleases,
I gotta pull away before she lets me go.
oh no, she thinks that I’m the dirt on her feet, I thought she was nice
now I think that she’s bitter-sweet.
There’s something about having what you think you want that makes you wonder if you want it at all,
it’s a no-contest, no-win, but at least there’s a beginning and an end.
