h1. A Heartbroken al3x Presents...

...a lyrical mix in text format spanning several days and multiple blog entries.  In true sad emo fuck should-be-Livejournaling-this fashion I'm going to post the lyrics to the songs that are(n't really very well) getting me through leaving the girl I desperately love(d).  Yes, that was like months ago, regular readers.  It's just sinking in.  Fuck off.

I'm also really busy with pre-ToorCon stuff, so this makes it seem like I've got content.  Psych!  You totally fell for it, sucka.

The mix starts now.
