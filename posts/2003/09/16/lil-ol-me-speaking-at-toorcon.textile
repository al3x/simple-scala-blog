h1. Lil' Ol' Me Speaking At ToorCon

I'm not sure how exactly this escaped posting until now, but it has, so time to rectify that: I'm speaking at "ToorCoon 2003":http://www.toorcon.org/ in a matter of days (_ulp!_).  My contribution, with psuedo-former Tangerine associate Phil Leif, is to the ""Securing Wireless"":http://www.toorcon.org/details.html?id=11 panel, on which I'll be talking about deploying "Soekris":http://www.soekris.com/ embedded systems running a custom distribution of "OpenBSD":http://www.openbsd.org/ for "openly secure" public 802.11b wireless access points.  Phil will talk about some of the business and logistical considerations of running public wireless networks, and we'll then join our associates on the panel to answer questions about, well, securing wireless.  It's gonna be the hot joint.

I've been eager to get out to ToorCon for several years, and I'm thrilled that I not only get to see the con, but speak at it.  In my eyes the convention falls somewhere between "SummerCon":http://www.summercon.org/ and "DefCon":http://www.defcon.org/: a security conference that's not overwhelmingly large, and has hands in both the professional InfoSec world and the "hacker underground," such as it is these days.  I guess I'll find if my suspicions are confirmed later this month.  I'm awful excited.  And I get to escape DC weather for sunny San Diego!  Or at least for a dark hotel in sunny San Diego.

So am I "l33t" yet?  ;-)
