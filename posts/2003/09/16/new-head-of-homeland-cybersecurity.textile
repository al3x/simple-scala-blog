h1. New Head of Homeland Cybersecurity

Yup, "new sherif in town":http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/09/15/HNczar_1.html.  The new G-man in question is one Amit Yoran, founder of Alexandria, VA information security house RipTech Inc.

I actually interviewed for an internship there before they got bought up by "Symantec":http://www.riptech.com/.  They didn't have the budget or staff flexibility at the time, which was a shame 'cause it was one sweet shop: biometrics on the doors, badass workstations for their intrusion analysts, killer labs, warroom-style central command area, etc.  I never met Yoran, big bossman that he was, but their other RipTech folks seemed pleasant and competent.  Let's hope he set that mold, and that he won't go handing out contracts to Symantec left and right.
