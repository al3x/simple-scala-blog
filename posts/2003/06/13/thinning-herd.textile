h1. Thinning the Herd

...where "herd" is to be read as "iTunes Music Library."  I've dumped tons of albums I just don't give a damn about anymore.  Yesterday alone several digitized discs of Plaid and Mu-Ziq bit the dust.  Over the past several weeks most of the melodic IDM in my collection had bitten the dust, save the innovators in the genre: Boards of Canada, Cex, and so forth.  That music is precious enough without poorly executed derivatives.  While I hate to see my library __decrease__ in size, it's nice not to have to skip through crap I just patently no longer like when listening to my whole library on shuffle.  Sorry, Plaid.
