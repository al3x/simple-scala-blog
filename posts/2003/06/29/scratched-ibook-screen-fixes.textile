h1. Scratched iBook Screen: Fixes?

My iBook has had a pretty good life: padded cases, frequent cleanings, general love and care.  So when a small-but-aggravatingly-noticable scratch appeared in the lower-right quadrant of its screen this evening it was a shock for both the machine and I.  The iBook wasn't near anything that might have caused the scratch, and I have a witness to that assertion.  But it is driving me nuts, and I'd love to hear some suggestions.

What say you all?  Is there a decent way of buffing out or otherwise removing this fingernail-edge-size scratch?  For the love of God say yes...
