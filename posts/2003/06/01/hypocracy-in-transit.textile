h1. Hypocracy In Transit?

So, uh, how do anti-globalization protesters, say of "the sort":http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2952922.stm who are presently hovering like gnats around Evian to denounce the G8 summit, get where they’re going?  Some of them seem to practically be “career” protesters: they go where anyone needs giant puppets and kids in black bandanas setting fires, and that makes for a busy, globe-hopping lifestyle.

So do they fly?  On multi-national corporate jets assembled from parts made in dozens of countries and fueled by Western and Middle Eastern oil?  Do these young self-proclaimed anarchists wait patiently until their row is called to board, or do they chant and set their tickets ablaze, eschewing the social conservatism of lines and queues?  It’s just always fascinated me, as these kids seem utterly unaware that their means of dissent, physical, economic, and intellectual, are undeniably interwoven with a “globalized” and, largely, pro-capital culture.  No wonder they haven’t yet provided a cohesive and intelligible alternative to the worldwide concerns they protest; they can’t get beyond the very trappings they protest.
