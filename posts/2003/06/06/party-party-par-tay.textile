h1. Party Party Par-tay

I said party over here!  Party over there!  Party in the blogosphere!  Hmm, yes, that does look as painfully dorky in writing as I expected.  No matter, because there's gonna be a sort of "blog-celeb shindig":http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/PartyInDC030708 in DC coinciding with the "Supernova conference":http://www.pulver.com/supernova/ on July 7th.  It's a ways off yet but the planning stages are already in full swing.  I'm trying to have my organizational say, Wiki-style.  Surely there's a place for us unknown minors amongst a crowd of mature professionals in the height of their notoriety?  Hmm.  That may be farther off than the whole "party over here" thingâ€¦
