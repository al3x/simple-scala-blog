h1. Link Buttons Revisited

Thanks to some differences between my layout/stylesheet and those of CSS link button creator Chris Pirillo's the lil' buggers don't display uniformly across browsers.  Baffling as it may seem, more people look at my site with IE on Windows XP than any other browser/OS platform.  And last I looked at the site on that platform-o-browser-evil, the CSS link buttons misrendered.  So I'm thinking of dropping them in favor of plain ol' text.  Would that break your hearts?  And leave too few "grahics" on the page?  And do I need a new title bar image?  That shot of mine from Somewhere, Japan that's been there since this site's reincarnation is getting a bit tiresome I think, and I have ever so many __other__ random shots from Japan I could stick there ;-)

Comments, people, really.
