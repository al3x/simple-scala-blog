h1. Meeting People Is Easy

I’m intrigued by the "DC Webloggers Meetup":http://blog.meetup.com/461, part of an international blog "meetup":http://www.meetup.com/ on that day.  It would be interesting to meet some other local bloggers, get some new opinions, etc.  It’s also a good excuse to get out of the house.  I’ll do it!  I’ll brave un-enforced social behavior!  ...with a %(=caps)SARS% mask on.  I mean, let’s not get crazy.
