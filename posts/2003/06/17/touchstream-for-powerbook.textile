h1. TouchStream for PowerBook!

Holy cats!  The geniuses at FingerWorks have made a "drop-in TouchStream keyboard":http://www.fingerworks.com/TS_PowerBook.html for Apple's PowerBook G4!  It's efficient keylessness to go!  If I had one of those aluminum beauties I'd be.. wishing it wasn't so expensive.  For now I remain quite happy with my TouchStream ST, though I gather they've now collapsed that line into "TouchStream LP":http://www.fingerworks.com/lp_product.html, which can be both placed on a frame like the ST or folded up and taken with you.  Clever kids.
