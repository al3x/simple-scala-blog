h1. Listen to More Rachel’s

"Rachel’s":http://www.southern.com/southern/band/RACHL/ are presently owning my little speakers.  There’s not a damn thing they can’t do: lush chamber music, textured electronic dirges, beautiful lyrical pieces, you name it.  Listen to "_Selenography_":http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00000IR6T/qid=1055794049/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/002-6306331-7880854?v=glance&amp;s=music&amp;n=507846 ("%(=caps)RIAA% safe!":http://www.magnetbox.com/riaa/check.asp?asin=B00000IR6T) and you’ll feel like you’re rocketing back and forth between 2004 and 1924.  It’s a good feeling.
