h1. Purging the Blogroll

It appears to be some sort of impromptu “summer cleaning” time in the digital home that is my iBook.  After skimming the crap out of my iTunes Library (and thus the iPod that syncs to it) I’m still itching for more refinement. Coincidentally I realized how much a number of my RSS subscriptions in NetNewsWire piss me off/are boring/are irrelevant.  What this is, of course, is a denouncement of these blogs, and their authors by proxy.  I was going to post the names of authors/blogs I’d denounced here, but that seems a bit _gauche_.  When I next update my blogroll those of you who really care can spot the differences.  All none of you.
