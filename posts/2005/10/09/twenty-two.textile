Tomorrow is my birthday.  I have no idea what to do.  It’s a holiday, but I might go to work anyway.
I already bought myself the only thing I wanted (the aforementioned Coheed &amp; Cambria/Blood Brothers  tickets).  If you’re feeling gifty, give to "Doctors Without Borders":http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/donate/.
