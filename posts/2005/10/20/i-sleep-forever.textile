h1. I Sleep Forever

The other day a post by the multi-talented Glen Rhodes entitled "“The power of the Sleep Cycle”":http://glenrhodes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=9 made the rounds.  The basic idea is that by making the most of your %(=caps)REM%-phase sleep (the sleep that’s most refreshing) you can get by on one 4.5 hour main sleep session and a shorter nap.

Having more time isn’t the main appeal of Rhodes’ observations.  I perked up at this passage:

bq. [The study on %(=caps)REM% sleep] explains why, when I get 8 hours of sleep I feel tired and groggy, or when I get 4 hour of sleep, I can barely wake up. As human beings, we should know about this fact, as everyone always says “get your 8 hours”. Yet some people fare better than others. Why is that? Probably because the more rested people are actually getting closer to 7.5, or 9 hours, while the 8 hour folk feel constantly unrested.

So I’m not about to start sleeping 5.5 hours a day, but I’ve been experimenting with trying to wake up without an alarm and letting my sleep cycles “come to a close.”  It works.  If you wake up when your body is ready to wake up, rather than when you _want_ to wake up, the usual grogginess is all but gone.
