h1. Lazyweb: Web-based BitTorrent Client?
I need a web-based BitTorrent client that’s suck-free.
"TorrentFlux":http://www.torrentflux.com/ is close, but not that close.  It’s %(=caps)PHP%, and that sucks.  The “stable” version is a year old and bug-riddled, and the beta under active development isn’t really any more stable, and that sucks.  Its interface kinda sucks.  Did I mention %(=caps)PHP%?
My ideal solution is written in Python.  It runs on Linux.  It speaks a current version of the BitTorrent protocol.  It works like this:

I run it and it toddles off into daemon-land.
I ask for http://localhost:9999 or whatever port I told it to run on and I see a pretty “web page”.
I either upload torrent files or feed it URLs to torrents.
It downloads said torrents to a local directory of my choosing.
Detailed status is displayed for each torrent in a clean, readable way.
Completed torrents automatically start seeding.
Torrents can be paused, stopped, and deleted.
It doesn’t fuck up, screwing up my ratios and requiring entirely too much manual intervention.

Thoughts?  Recommendations?  “DIY, jerk”?
