h1. On The Offensive?

Continuing, much to my dismay, my complaints about horrific background music, I’m back at Murky VA where, since sitting down half an hour ago, I’ve been forced to suffer The White Stripes, some bargain basement metal, a now Daft’s Punk “One More Time” played entirely in the wrong spirit and made all the more heinous by baristas maliciously singing along.  The paranoid in me thinks an employee saw my blog and ensured I’d be tormented as soon as I sat down, but the pragmatist in me knows _nobody_ reads this fucker.

Maybe I should have purchased earphones with a little more isolation.  Or maybe I should burst my eardrums with a coffee stirrer.
