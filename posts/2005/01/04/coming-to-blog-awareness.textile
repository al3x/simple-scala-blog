h1. Coming To Blog Awareness

In the face of endless rehashed wire stories on the "explosion of blog readership in America" the last day or so, Erik "asks":http://nslog.com/archives/2005/01/04/qotd_blog_awareness.php: "When did you reach 'Blog Awareness?'"

One of the minor regrets I have about this site is that I lack archives from my early days of "Blogger":http://www.blogger.com usage.  My archives here only go back to 2002, but I was "blogging" back in 1999 when Blogger first launched.  Of course, even though I was using a service called _Blogger_, at the time I merely viewed it as an easier way to update my site's news page, taking a cue from the design sites I then frequented .  I didn't realize I was part of a growing trend or community until mid-2000 when the term started to become pervasive.

Of course, the true "old guard" of bloggers go "much farther back":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#History in the history of the web.  But compared to the current "explosion," I'm old school.  So, uh, give it up for me.
