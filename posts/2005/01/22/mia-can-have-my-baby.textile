h1. M.I.A. Can Have My Baby

Richard "beat me to the punch":http://www.justagwailo.com/filter/2005/01/20/mia, but M.I.A. and Diplo’s “Piracy Funds Terrorism” has been blasting out of every audio output device I own for the last couple weeks and I’m totally smitten.  Any girl with a flow like that… damn.  Check out the video Richard links to for evidence that she’s as easy on the eyes as the ears.  That smile, that I-don’t-have-to-dance-like-those-dancehall-hootchies-’cos-I’m-the-MC wiggle…  _le sigh_

Same goes for all the ladies on "Junglistic Sistaz":http://www.junglistic-sistaz.com.  Totally volunteering to be your baby daddy, right here.
