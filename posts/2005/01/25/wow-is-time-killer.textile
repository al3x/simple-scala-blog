h1. WoW Is The Time Killer

I learned something this evening: World of Warcraft, like every other MMORPG I’ve ever tried or been witness to, is not for me.  I reiterate my limited gaming preference for arcade-style fighters, silly racing games _a la_ Mario Kart and Burnout, and little else.  This is why I don’t own a console, much less game on my PowerBook (which did handle the lovely graphics of WoW admirably).

It probably didn’t help that my first steps in the virtual world were as Night Elf Druid and an Undead Warlock, according to my Warcrack dealers two of the harder race/class combinations to play.  But what helps less is my fundamental lack of comfort with adopting a pastime that finds me regularly referring to “Night Elves” and “Warlocks.”  I [mis]spent enough of my youth playing Magic: The Gathering; that dark time is long since over.

So really, my absence of affinity for the fantasy genre as a whole is probably the deal-breaker here, as all press hype and word of mouth is befitting of World of Warcraft.  Were there a cyberpunk MMORPG of similar quality I’d probably be wasting away  in my desk chair rather than typing this entry.  But thankfully for the creative portions of my brain not concerned with gaming strategy (as I hesitate to dismiss gaming as an uncreative pastime) there is no such thing.  Though I lost an evening, tomorrow I intend to make up for it in metric Rails LOCs.

And now I know what all the fuss is about.
