h1. Overheard/Seen on SF Trip

* "Super7":http://www.super7store.com/, Japantown; girl at register to apparently frequent customer: “I hear monkey is the new octopus.”
* Comic Relief, Berkley; young man to friend working register: “So my brother finally got arrested, but I got my CD back!” [brandishes copy of “The Chronic”]
* Cafe, Castro: a lesbian couple in early middle age, one Japanese American, the other with a German(?) accent, finishes dinner while the previous’ adorable toddling daughter plays with a pint-sized toy cell phone.
* MUNI (Inbound), late afternoon: two girls (Korean?) in early teens (braces) browse a Victoria’s Secret catalog, loudly commenting on their shared preference for one thong cut over another.
* Castro on the way to Chow, early evening, clearly gay guy talking loudly on mobile: “He is such a _hustler!_ [...]  Well if he won’t do a threesome we’ll just have to figure out some other arrangement!”
* "Giant Robot":http://www.giantrobot.com/ Store, midday: the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen in my life working the register.  Of gorgeously elusive ethnicity; lithe, elegant features; startling eyes; long, full, natural dreadlocks down her back; delicate piercings, strictly stainless steel jewelry.  Was barely able to communicate enough to complete transaction, so stunned by beauty was I.  Left in a daze.
