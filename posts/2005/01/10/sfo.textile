h1. SFO

I’ll be in San Francisco from this coming Friday mid-day (1/14) to the subsequent Tuesday morning (1/18).  If you:

# live there and wanna hang out with me;
# know of a really, really good tattoo shop there;
# can recommend pretty much any place to eat/shop/do things there;

...then please let me know.

It’s yet another small trip to tide me over until one of several Big Real Vacations I’ve been intending on for the last couple years but I’m looking forward to it nonetheless.  Stupid cheap airfare, too.  Yay for escaping DC in the gloom of winter.
