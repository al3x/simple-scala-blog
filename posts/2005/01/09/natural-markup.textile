h1. Natural Markup
No, "Richard":http://www.movableblog.com/asides/2005/01/06/1836, you’re not alone in having to look up wiki markup syntax and the sentiment that it defeats the purpose of the easy, natural writing and editing that Wikis are supposed to encourage.  I use a different wiki at work than for personal projects and loathe the previous; if I’m not writing straight %(=caps)HTML I% want to be writing "Markdown":http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/.  Were that all wikis were "Instiki":http://www.instiki.org and offered a choice of editing syntaxes (or just settled on the beauty that is Markdown) this wouldn’t be an issue, but many wikis insist on using arbitrary, unintuitive markup.
You can tell those wikis to *suck it*.
