h1. An Unspecified Number of Things

I lied.  "43 Things":http://43things.com/people/view/al3x, really.  I’m not there yet, not nearly, but I do have a number of things I want to do with my special unique snowflake life.  And that’s what 43 Things does: it lets snowflakes list what they want to do, and correlates those things into a big happy snowshower of life activities.  Browsing it is mildly addictive, but in an inspiring, positive way; it’s not one of those seedy voyeuristic corners of the net, no sir.  People on 43 Things just want to "make sweet love":http://43things.com/things/view/10782.

43 Things was built on "Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.com/.  Rails delights me in portions of my being that I never knew existed, much less were capable of being delighted by a web application framework.  My infatuation with "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/, dormant two long years, has been mightily rekindled by Rails.  I really quite genuinely want to "drink a beer or 12":http://43things.com/things/view/7920 with "David Heinemeier Hansson":http://www.loudthinking.com/.
