h1. Imitates Life

"Questionable Content":http://www.questionablecontent.net/ is so dense with references, slang, and characters from my own life that I really want to dislike it.  But I cannot.  It is also dense with humor.  Humors, really.  Geek humor.  Indie rock humor.  Young person relationship humor.  Robot humor.  Anime humor.  Humors.  Read it, and while you're at it prepare yourself for the next installment of "Krakow":http://www.krakowstudios.com.
