h1. Please Stop Stripping Away Male Identity With Language

"Man date?":http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/10/fashion/10date.html?ei=5090&amp;en=37bef79604f97228&amp;ex=1270785600&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;pagewanted=all  Metrosexual?  Why can’t men just be men?  Is everyone in this country so insecure and simple that the idea of anything other than the beer-n-sports image of the American male has to be broken into a dismissible social group/market demographic?  Why is the %(=caps)NYT% publishing this bullshit?

Maybe it’s because I’m sitting in a tea shop (in the limited scope of the article, that it’s anyplace other than a sports bar is what counts) with a good male friend right now and wouldn’t possibly designate that time as anything other than “time with a friend,” but I can’t help but feel that article and the scads of “metrosexual” coverage before it should’ve been left in the bins of the dim, lazy, superficial writers who dreamed these distinctions up.
