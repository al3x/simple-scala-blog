h1. The Switch

If you catch me on AIM in the next couple weeks my responses may be slow.  Really slow.

Thanks to the "Dvorak Zine":http://dvzine.org, which I picked up from one of its authors at the SPX this past weekend, I've seen the light and am making the switch to Dvorak.  It's not about speed, but about comfort.  Typing Dvorak makes sense; it just feels right.

Learning is slow going.  I touch-typed 100+ words per minute on QWERTY, and I don't expect that back soon.  Typing slowly is allowing my aching hands to heal, however, so I'm taking it in stride.

That took forever to type.  Whew.
