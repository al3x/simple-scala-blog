h1. Deliver A Favor
"Coheed and Cambria":http://www.coheedandcambria.com, pretty much my favorite band to sing along to, is on tour with the "Blood Brothers":http://www.thebloodbrothers.com, pretty much my favorite band to scream along to.  They’re playing two shows in the DC area in November.  The first is on Saturday the 5th at "Sonar":http://www.sonar.us in Baltimore.  The second is Monday the 7th at the "9:30 Club":http://www.930.com.
I have one ticket to each.  None of my friends are fans of either band, so I will go alone.  Last year Co&amp;Ca played the 9:30 Club the day after my 21st birthday, and I got to smugly drink a Guiness whilst the kiddies moshed about.  Good times.
At any rate, if you’re also going to these shows, you should let me know.  We can be all, “I really enjoy the Coheed &amp; Cambria comic book, no matter how nerdy it is.  Songs about intergalactic war are awesome.”
And so forth.
