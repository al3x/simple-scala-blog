h1. SPX MTHRFKR!

This weekend is the "Small Press Expo":http://www.spxpo.com/ in my home town of Bethesda, MD.  I'm going for the first time in several years.  The exhibitors include far more webcomics than I remember, but I've got no qualms with that.

At the last SPX I went to I got to have "Chynna":http://www.spxpo.com/ sign one of my Bleu Monday books, and I met "Brian Wood":http://www.brianwood.com when his seminal Channel Zero was just out.  It was awesome.  Not your average comic con.

I'm going with "Ben":http://www.steeltoe.org.  Join us, won't you?
