h1. The Suburbs Are Killing Us
Read "every last word of this":http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,6000,1418246,00.html, though take it with a grain of salt as warranted by the source.  It may be a voyeuristic scare story to shake up smart Brits over Sunday breakfast, but its author puts his finger on what’s so broken in America.
Living in the suburbs feels dishonest for me, every day.  The libertarian in me says, “let people live that way, as long as I don’t have to,” and I look desperately at Craigslist apartment prices in cities far and near.  But that’s wrong.  Someone living in an exurb still effects all the people who move to cities and try to forget there’s such a thing as sprawl.  We’re all on the same sociopolitical grid, as it were, and as long as you care about other people you can’t dissociate from it.
