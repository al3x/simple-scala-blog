h1. Uncomment
Comments have been closed on all posts due to a wave of comment spam.  The offending comments themselves should all be purged from the database.  Thank you, Mr. H. Shiteyes Spammer, for using the same terms in all of your spams, as it took literally seconds in the MySQL shell to delete them.
Measures to prevent comment spamming will be included in the new blog engine (the irony of this much-delayed project being that I’m far more interested in writing it than actually blogging at the moment, one of those “actual creation is more valuable than incessant babbling” kicks).
If you have something to say about a post in the meantime, say it direct to me.
