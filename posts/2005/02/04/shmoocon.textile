h1. ShmooCon

I’ll be at "Shmoocon":http://www.shmoocon.org/ this weekend.

I’m a little burned out on hacker cons, but Shmoocon – being located right here in DC, put on by friends and colleagues, and free to me thanks to a pass handout “for the community” at a 2600 meeting a few months back – requires such infinitesimal effort and outlay of resources on my part that I have no excuse but to go.

Say “die” if you’re around.  I’ll be blogging interesting panels as I see fit and as connectivity permits.
