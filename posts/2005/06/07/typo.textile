h1. Typo
I moved this lot over to "Typo":http://typo.leetsoft.com because the My First Rails Blog Engine™ I wrote months ago was apparently leaving hung processes all over my host’s machine.  Which puzzles me, as it doesn’t *do* anything, but whatever.  Typo has all these “features” and “tests” is a far better system overall.
Things might look a little bit different and your feeds may be broken.  New feed links are listed on the right as usual.  Dig the “Live Search.”
