h1. What’s Good and What’s Bullshit at DefCon 13

This is more for my scheduling purposes than anything else, but I thought I’d share.  Given that my friends and I will be busy with Capture The Flag at this year’s DefCon (just mere weeks away!) I won’t have a lot of time to see talks.  I played in %(=caps)CTF% last year and didn’t see a single talk; given that I’m helping to run the contest this year I don’t have high hopes for my free time.

If I get a spare minute this is what I’ll be seeing, what I’ll be avoiding, and what I’ll be divided on, culled from the "DefCon 13 Speakers Page":http://defcon.org/html/defcon-13/dc13-speakers.html:
