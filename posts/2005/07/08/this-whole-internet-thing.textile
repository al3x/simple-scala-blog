h1. This Whole Internet Thing

bq. "This whole Internet thing, be it blogging, online dating, 'hookup' sites, never panned out in terms of meeting potential partners"

For all the "email is broken" hype I still find it to be the best way to get to know someone online, for business or pleasure.  Good ol' fashion' one-to-one correspondence goes a long way.
