h1. The Ghosts of Dead Teenagers Sing to Me While I Am Dancing

If you missed "My Favorite":http://www.lostdetective.com/ at the "Rickshaw Stop":http://www.rickshawstop.com/ last night you pretty much blew it.  Nobody else writes songs about languishing in love and music and loneliness like they do.  And If someone does, well, they don't have the stage presence to compete.

"When the dance floor clears, I walk home alone with their voices still in my ears."
