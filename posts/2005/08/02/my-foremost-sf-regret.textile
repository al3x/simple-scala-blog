h1. My Foremost SF Regret
I’ll miss the beautiful weather.  I’ll miss Tacqueria Can-Cun, my superbly grumpy pho place in Sunset, and all the other great food.  I’ll miss people being outwardly friendly, if often disingenuous.  But my one big regret is that I left San Francisco without getting some serious work done by artist "Jason Tyler Grace":http://jasontylergrace.com/bodyart.asp.
Grace, from the work of his that I’ve seen, is phenomenal.  His blacks are deep, sharp, and clean.  His colors – particularly at the warm end of the spectrum – are vibrant and expertly mixed.  Most of all, his pieces are confidently executed, even when bringing together the sort of detail that most artists couldn’t even manage in a creative sandbox like Photoshop, much less permanently embedded into flesh.
More of his work can be seen in the Guardian’s "Best of the Bay 2005":http://www.bestofthebay.com/2005/gall.php?i=2#GUT tattoo special.  I’d consider going back to SF in a year or two just to have him work on me.
