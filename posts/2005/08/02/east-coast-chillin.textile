h1. East Coast Chillin’

After ten weeks on the Left Coast I’m back in the greater DC metro area once again, decompressing for a few days at my folks’ place in Annapolis.  It feels great to be back home.  I feel like I’m looking at the place through the fresh lens.

DefCon in general and "our":https://www.kenshoto.com Capture The Flag in particular went great.  I’ll have lots to post on that in days to come, once I have it all sorted out in my head.

I should be back in Northern VA this coming weekend, and moving the following weekend.  Holler at me if you’d like to meet up.
