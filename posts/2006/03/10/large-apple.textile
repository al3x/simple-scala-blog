I will be in %(=caps)NYC% from today through Monday afternoon.  Since the rest of The City is going to %(=caps)SXSW I% expect that it will be a pleasant and carefree time.

Upon my return you can expect the same insightful, authoritative, and deeply personal blogging Iâ€™ve been delivering daily over the last two weeks.
