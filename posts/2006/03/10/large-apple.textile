I will be in NYC from today through Monday afternoon.  Since the rest of The City is going to SXSW I expect that it will be a pleasant and carefree time.

Upon my return you can expect the same insightful, authoritative, and deeply personal blogging Iâ€™ve been delivering daily over the last two weeks.
