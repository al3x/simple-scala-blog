h1. A Day Early

I’m back from NYC a day early, and despite my best intentions of getting right back to the office I instead caught up on the sleep deficit accrued this weekend.  It’s 85 degrees here in DC.  I can’t parse this fact, so sleeping until it’s _not_ 85 degrees seemed like a good alternative.

New York was beautiful.  I like the city more every time I’m there, and I used to not like it at all.  But the city itself wasn’t the feature of my weekend.

People talk about online community a lot.  They talk about its potential for political change, cultural evolution, and economic optimization.  But you haven’t really seen the power of online community until you’ve seen this exchange:

_Person 1:_ Hi, I’m Person 1.  I’m HandleFoo on the site.

_Person 2:_ Ohmygod!  I’m HandleBar.  I’ve been waiting to meet you for ages!

_Person 1 and Person 2 hug._

Imagine that over and over again.  People brought together in friendship by the smallest common thread.  It’s testament to the best part of human nature.  All we need is the excuse of commonality to treat each other with compassion and generosity.

Also, I forgot my mobile’s charger in the hotel room, so don’t be miffed if you can’t call or txt me.
