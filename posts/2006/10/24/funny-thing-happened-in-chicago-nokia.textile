h1. A Funny Thing Happened In The Chicago Nokia Concept Store
The C4 coverage is coming, promise.  Now then.
While in Chicago this past weekend we stopped into the Nokia concept store in the “Magnificent Mile” shopping district.  I got hands-on with a bunch of phones I thought I wanted but quickly realized I didn’t.  The N-Series phones are really crap: bulky things with sub-par displays.  I browsed some more traditional models but nothing grabbed me.
As I was getting ready to leave, a gentleman adjacent to me asked a salesperson if they carry the Nokia %(=caps)E60%.  The salesperson replied that no, the %(=caps)E60% is a European model so they don’t carry it at this store.  I quickly piped up and said, “here, I have one in my pocket!”  The gentleman and his colleague inspected the phone, asking questions about its features, nodding approvingly the whole time.
In front of the salesperson we had a discussion about where to purchase an unlocked version of the %(=caps)E60% for a reasonable price ("TigerDirect":http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2219450 is the answer).  Satisfied, the gentleman and his colleague left.  The salesperson glared at me before I rejoined my friends and went on my way.
