h1. C4 Wrapup

I can’t recommend C4 enough.  It was a great conference in a great location at a great price, and a fantastic argument for keeping such events small and focused.  It felt like a classroom, or rather like the sort of classroom I wish I’d had access to during my eduction.  The long Q&#38;A sessions and open dialog amongst speakers and attendees was supremely valuable.  Hell, even the food was good.  It’s hard to ask for much more.

I’ll be back next year without a doubt.  Hats off to "Wolf":http://www.rentzsch.com/ for putting it all together.
