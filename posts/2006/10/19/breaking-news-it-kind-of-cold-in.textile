h1. Breaking News: It's Kind Of Cold In Chicago
Landed in Chicago this morning a bit ahead of schedule.  Getting to the airport bloody early can have its advantages.
We had a delicious brunch at "Orange":http://chicago.citysearch.com/profile/11549946/: pumpkin pancakes, fresh orange-carrot juice, and frushi.  I’m presently in one of the much-touted "Intelligentsia Coffee":http://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/ locations.  Their barista skills are confirmed; my espresso macchiato was excellent.
Today we’re bumming around Bucktown, then seeing some improv at "Second City":http://www.secondcity.com/ before dinner at "Adobo Grill":http://www.adobogrill.com/.  Tomorrow we take an architectural boat tour of the city before "C4":http://rentzsch.com/c4/ kicks into gear.
I’ll try to blog as much of the conference as time, facilities, and circumstances allow.  If I can live blog, I will.  If I can’t, expect posts the next morning for the conference’s respective days.
I hope I packed enough warm stuff.  It’s nippy.
