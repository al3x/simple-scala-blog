h1. Damn The DRM
p. 
I really like that ad, and the rest of the "winners of the Down With %(=caps)DRM% contest":http://torrentfreak.com/winners-of-the-down-with-drm-video-contest-announced/.
I gave up on purchasing %(=caps)DRM%-crippled music years ago.  I bought two songs and one album on the iTunes Store and have long since gone through too many authorized computers to use them anymore, not to mention Apple locking me out of my account through email address confusion.
We were getting in the habit of grabbing the occasional TV show from iTunes, right up until our evening was ruined the other week by a bad download.  It took two days before Apple gave me the shows I paid for.  In those two days I could’ve downloaded the entire season of that show, if not the entire series, in a higher-quality format that isn’t broken.  Even if it means not being able to click and have a show ten minutes later, I will not buy another %(=caps)DRM%-crippled video from Apple.
Watch the videos, learn, and spread the message.
