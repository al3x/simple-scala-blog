h1. Purge 2: A Comic Book I'll Never Write

Setting: Tehran, just after "Iran bans Western music":http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4543720.stm.

Plot: a bunch of kids are trying to throw Tehran’s best leftfield dance night.  Youth and art clashes with politics and faith, the importation/exportation/reinterpretation of culture is explored via dubplates and massive choons, someone falls in love, we all learn something over two or three 20-odd page issues.

Art: ideally, a different artist for each arc of the story.  Lots of postmodern riffing on Islamic motifs, repeating patterns skewered with Western iconography.  Sketchy, heavy outlines, fluid movement.  ‘Nuff hott Iranian girls.  "Darkpony":http://www.digi-digi.net/.
