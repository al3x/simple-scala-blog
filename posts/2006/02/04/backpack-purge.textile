h1. Backpack Purge

I have a semi-rational fear that  "Backpack":http://www.backpackit.com/ is going to explode/disappear at any minute.  I've been relying on it as an ever-present digital scrapbook for about six months now.   All I ever store is text, though.  No need for a wacky web app to store a bunch of text.

The next several posts are things that've been sitting around in my Backpack for ages.  Having a nice place to put things means you're entirely too likely to file-and-forget.
