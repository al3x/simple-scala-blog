h1. Happy Valentine's Day

...or, as I like to call it, International Lonely Shoegazers Have An Ironic Listen Of “Loveless” Day.

Seriously, you should listen to this record anyway.  It’ll change the way you think about music, and probably explain where a few of your favorite bands got their ideas.

Unrelated, the older I get and the longer I’m single, the more I like hearing stories of happy couples.  Pretty soon I’m going to be -renting- stealing romantic comedies and crying at weddings and so forth.

Listen to the record already.
