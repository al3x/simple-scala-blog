Last week my PowerBook's hard drive failed.  Only a year and a half old, but that's the way it goes.  I promptly replaced the drive and sold the machine to a friend; the lure of a new MacBook was simply too great.

But when I got my shiny new machine home, all was not well.  There was, apparently, a young asp trapped just below the left speaker grille.  My new MacBook _hissed_ at me.  Had I angered it so soon?

To Google I went, and then to Apple's support forums.  Lo and behold, hundreds of other MacBook owners being whined at by their expensive new purchases.  Apple's official stance?  Denial.

This is not the sort of thing I take lightly.

I've started a "petition":http://www.petitiononline.com/whinefix/petition.html to fix the MacBook Pro whine flaw.  If you or someone you know is tired of being whined at, take a stand and sign the petition.
