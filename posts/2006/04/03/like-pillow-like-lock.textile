h1. Like A Pillow. Like a Lock.

The best girl trouble album in the world is, and has been, and will be: "Mad For Sadness":http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00004TXXC?v=glance by "Arab Strap":http://www.arabstrap.co.uk/, and that's all there is to it.

I think my perspective on male-female relationships is lying somewhere in the media valley between "When Harry Met Sally":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098635/ and "Songs About Fucking":http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000019GE?v=glance.

Reasonably sure this is not healthy.
