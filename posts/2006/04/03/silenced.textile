h1. Silenced!

Yesterday I posted a thread about the aforementioned "petition":http://www.petitiononline.com/whinefix/petition.html on Apple’s MacBook Pro support forum.  This morning I went back to check on the discussion and it was gone.  Unbelievable.

%(=caps)TUAW% has some "interesting info":http://www.tuaw.com/2006/04/02/does-the-macbook-pro-fan-constantly-run-and-a-note-about-the-wh/ if you’re following the MacBook issue(s), and "Daily Tech":http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=1584 suggests that revised models are shipping, although no word on whether the whine is amongst the fixes.
