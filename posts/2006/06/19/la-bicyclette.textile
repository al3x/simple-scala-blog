h1. La Bicyclette

I bought a bicycle this weekend, a "Novara Fusion":http://www.rei.com/product/47970934.htm.  For being REI’s house brand Novara makes quite nice bikes.

"Ben":http://steeltoe.org/ helped me pick it out, and aptly described it as “having this grrrr city bike _Mad Max_ thing going on.”  It’s that, but it’s also kind of old-timey in its colors and styling.  What I like best is that it came ready to be a total car replacement; with a good bag and some paniers there’s very little that one couldn’t haul on the Fusion that one couldn’t have delivered instead.
