I was long overdue to run this site's feeds through "FeedBurner":http://www.feedburner.com.  You can now subscribe to a feed that offers "my del.icio.us links":http://del.icio.us/al3x and "Flickr photos":http://www.flickr.com/photos/al3xpayne/ (if I ever add some) alongside the usual blog posts all in one handy URL: "http://feeds.feedburner.com/al3x":http://feeds.feedburner.com/al3x

Old feeds will still work, of course.
