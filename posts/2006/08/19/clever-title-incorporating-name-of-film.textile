h1. Clever Title Incorporating Name Of Film in Question
I would like to make one thing clear to those of you who may be wondering about _Snakes On A Plane_: it is a gore flick first and a campy action movie a distant, distant second.
In expecting a campy action movie I was expecting scene after scene of contrived tension carried to absurd ends.  What I saw last night was some writer’s list of horrible ways to die, most but not all of them snake-related.  The deaths are mostly governed by standard horror film ethics: anyone having sex, doing drugs, or being unpleasant in a stereotypical way is doomed to a gruesome fate.
When an anonymous plane denizen is trampled and dies of a high heel embedded in his ear, it’s time to leave.  I didn’t enjoy such unnecessary brutality in _Saw II_ or _Hostel_, and no amount of  internet meme frenzy could convince me that _Snakes_ was worth sitting through.
