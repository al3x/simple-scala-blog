h1. Serious Touring
In a few minutes Craig and I are leaving to play the first date of our DJing tour.  Three cities, three nights: Boston, Providence, %(=caps)NYC%.  More info "on the Serious DJs site":http://www.seriousdjs.net/2006/08/07/the-like-switzerland-tour.
So far, no problems.  We made good time from DC to Boston despite a traffic jam in New York.  A little tired but no pre-show jitters.  Big mix plannned tonight, believe.
