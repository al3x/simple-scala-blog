h1. Albums Of The Mid-Year

More than halfway through 2006 there are only two records I think I’ll still adore in a few more months:

"He Poos Clouds":http://www.google.com/musicl?lid=YDfjhEUstrF&#38;aid=mn9Q-AZu_8G by "Final Fantasy":http://finalfantasyeternal.com/ and Burial’s "self-titled full length":http://pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/36986/Burial_Burial.

Clearly I need to scrounge more music.  I’m getting to that point when looking through my library is like a grocery aisle full of unappetizing canned foods.
