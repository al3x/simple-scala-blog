h1. A Wi-Fi Poll

If you have a wi-fi router at home do you run it open or closed?  If closed, do you use %(=caps)WEP%/WPA or %(=caps)MAC% filtering or what?  What’s your logic either way?  Leave a comment if you please.

I’m curious to see how people are using home wireless networks several years on.  I just opened up my router after a year or so of running it closed for no particular reason.  Feel free to surf if you find yourself in Clarendon; the %(=caps)SSID% is nice_packets_lol.
