h1. Take That, Sturdy 1940s Construction
As of last night I’m comfortable saying that Timoni and I are All Moved In.  Walls are painted, books are on shelves, boxes have been removed, new Ikea furniture has been built, everything is organized.
The nail in the move-in coffin was actually a number of screws embedded in our ancient and infinitely dense walls.  I’m not exactly “handy” – I didn’t really know where to start when trying to get shelves and such hung in such material.  Thankfully, "that’s what the intarwebs are for":http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/ny/good-questions/good-questions-anchoring-shelves-in-a-brick-wall-003051.  One masonry drill bit and assorted anchors later I now have a swanky glass marker board and a fold-out standing desk.  As much as I like working from "the coffee shop":http://www.murkycoffee.com, it’s going to be hard to leave such a nice work space.
I’m really happy with how the place looks.  I bet Timoni will have pictures up soon, and we’d love to have you over.  Yes, you.  Bring vino.
%(=caps)UPDATE%: "Here are the photos":http://flickr.com/photos/timoni/sets/72157594249977609/, as promised.  You still need to come over!
