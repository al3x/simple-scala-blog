h1. Oh Gosh We're Back
It’s been too long, but here’s an early -holiday- Christmas present from Serious DJs to you: "The Gettin’ Paper Anniversary Mix":http://www.seriousdjs.net/2006/12/14/the-gettin-paper-anniversary-mix.  It’s hip-hop to dubstep to grime to breakcore to Baltimore to disco.  Just another trip around the block.
Share the joy.
