h1. Several Things
Condensing events since my last posting into easily-digestable info-nuggets:

The network attached storage solution I settled on is the "Infrant ReadyNAS NV":http://infrant.com/, which I purchased diskless from "Aegis":http://www.eaegis.com/.  It arrived yesterday.  First impression: cute.  The disks I’m putting in it arrive today.  Review to appear in due time.
"Craig and I":http://www.seriousdjs.net/ are booked to play the "Beat Research":http://beatresearch.com/ night in Boston in August and other gigs are falling into place.  We’ve been deep in practice mode the last few weeks.  A new mix will appear when we’re good and ready.  In the mean time, if you know of a quirky, friendly DJ night in your town, please let us know.  We don’t expect to be career DJs but we sure do like playing music for people.
I ran into an old high school friend the other night who’s apparently been reading this here blog on and off for the last several years.  If you’re a regular reader but rarely comment, please say hi.
"Timoni":http://www.synergizement.com/blog/ moved in with me on Monday.  I am, unqualified, the happiest guy.
