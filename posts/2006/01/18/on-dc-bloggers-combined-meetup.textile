h1. On The DC Bloggers Combined Meetup

There have been two factions of DC-area bloggers meeting up every month: the proper Meetup that I've attended and a self-organized happy hour.  This evening the two events merged, and our more reserved Meetup crowd was injected with the vitality that only a bunch of happy hour veterans can contribute.

I've lost count – and the URLs – of all the people I met; everyone was in fine spirits.  The one consistency of note: ask a given blogger what they blog bout and you're more than likely to get a self-depricating response to the effect that they write about a little bit of everything but mostly personal stuff.  Many bloggers I talked to haven't at it long, but even in this age of topic-specific "professional" weblogs, few are choosing to limit themselves to just one subject.  There's a diarist in us all, it seems.

If you're a Meetup attendee who managed to remember my site the next morning, please leave a comment so I can try to put sites with faces.  Maybe I'll see some of you at the "DCist happy hour":http://www.dcist.com/archives/2006/01/10/first_big_party_of_new_year_to_be_debauched_fun.php, if I can work up the social resolve to spend another evening in a smoky, sardine-packed DC bar.
