h1. Just Read His Blog Instead

Another one of my ill-fated projects was starting a blog about thought and critical theory with "Phil":http://millionairesocialite.com/.  But he just moved to New York City, I’m really busy again, and the subject matter really doesn’t warrant the waste of bandwidth.

Just read his blog, which is principally about fashion and the economics and sociology thereof.  It’s neat, even if you’re not into fashion.  There are graphs.

Big luck in the Big Apple bwoy.
