h1. Technical Ish

Email sent to my usual address seems to be bouncing.

I've been forwarding that address to a Gmail account for months now, but sometime last night Google decided that wasn't cool, and is sending back nasty little *PERM_FAILURE: SMTP Error (state 9): 554  Relay access denied* messages to any poor soul that tries to email me.

Except that spam is still getting through.  Just not, y'know, emails I want.  Thanks, Google.

I've emailed Gmail support about it but I don't expect any resolution, ever.

_UPDATE:_ seems to have resolved itself.  Weirdness.
