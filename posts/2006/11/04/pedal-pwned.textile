h1. Pedal Pwned

My bike got stolen.  If you see anyone riding around Arlington on a maroon Novara Fusion, tackle 'em.  And maybe think twice before leaving your bike locked up overnight at the Clarendon metro.  Yes, Clarendon.

I didn't particularly _like_ the bike from an aesthetic perspective.  It got me places, but it didn't have the relaxed ride I'd want from a commuter bike.  It was increasingly having little glitches, a bit premature given how new it was and the light riding I do.  Screws coming out, the handlebar loosening every couple rides, fittings coming off, the lights not working most of the time.

But hey: that's someone else's problem now.  I hope you end up with a spoke through your lung, thief.
