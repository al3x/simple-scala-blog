h1. Human Testing, Unit Testing

The Windows Vista team knows something about "finding bugs":http://news.com.com/Vistas+last+mile+-+page+2/2009-1016_3-6133357-2.html after all:

bq. “Donnelly [who manages part of Microsoft’s Vista test operation] tries to do the opposite of what an IT manager would recommend.  He changes all the default settings, for instance. And instead of testing a clean installation on a new machine, he’ll try to upgrade an older model.  ‘You find bugs,’ he said, ‘You absolutely find bugs that way.’”

It’s a start.

The security guy in me has a hard time choking down the "Unit Testing":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing doctrine.  Programmers don’t find deep bugs in their own code.  Machines don’t find deep bugs when running in a contrived development/testing environment.  These approaches find surface bugs, and that’s valuable, but they shouldn’t help you sleep at night.

People doing dumb and/or malicious shit finds deep bugs.  You can’t script dumb and malicious.
