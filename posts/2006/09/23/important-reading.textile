h1. Important Reading

Matt Webb’s "App After App":http://interconnected.org/notes/2006/09/webapps/ (or: “a zoology of next year’s web applications”) is _essential_.  Webb has his eyes on all the important technologies, ideas, and growing markets.  What’s more, he’s neatly collected them together for the rest of us to sit back and nod our heads to.  Generous.

Read it now or overhear it in six months.
