h1. al3xs On A Plane

We leave for London later today, and I get to re-discover the joys of red eye flights, albeit with Jack Daniels and melatonin this time around (I was maybe 15 last time I went to the UK).  Wednesday we do touristy stuff, Thursday and Friday I'm at "RailsConf Europe":http://europe.railsconf.org while T explores the city on her own, and then tourism resumes for me over the weekend.  We return next Tuesday.

I'm happy with how my talk for RailsConf has come together.  There looks to be lots of good content at the conference, and I'm happy they finally "sold out":http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/9/9/railsconf-europe-sold-out-and-almost-here.  It'll be interesting to see the differences between hacker cons and more, uh, "professional" conferences.

On the same topic, I'm registered to attend the aforementioned-on-this-blog "C4":http://c4.rentzsch.com/0/ conference in Chicago next month.  I hope I'm not taking a slot from a real actual Mac developer, but I'll try to make up for that by noteblogging the hell out of the respective talks.

It's nice to be traveling regularly again!
