h1. al3x at Web 2.0

When rounding up my schedule for the next couple of months, I forgot to mention that I'll be speaking at "O'Reilly's Web 2.0 Expo":http://sf.web2expo.com right here in San Francisco in late April.

On Wednesday, April 23rd, "Michal Migurski":http://mike.teczno.com/ (of "Stamen":http://www.stamen.com/) and I will be presenting a talk called "Design Your API: Learnings from Twitter and Stamen":http://en.oreilly.com/webexsf2008/public/schedule/detail/2266.  It's kind of a cool session, we think: Mike talks about consuming APIs from a developer/design perspective, and I talk about creating and maintaining APIs from a provider perspective.  There's going to be war stories and pretty graphs.  I'm excited.

Funnily enough, there's a panel at SXSW called "Building Developer-Friendly Web Service APIs":http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels_schedule/?action=show&id=IAP060350 that's on the same tip.  With "APIs continuing to crop up left and right":http://www.programmableweb.com/, it's no surprise that people want to nosh on some best practices.  Michal and I intend to deliver, so join us in San Francisco!
