Nobody is voting in your stead.  Many people are voting against what you believe in.  Get out and "vote":http://maps.google.com/vote.  Do the right thing: vote for "Barack Obama":http://barackobama.com/ and give America a chance at a brighter future.

If you're in California, "Vote No on Prop 8":http://www.noonprop8.com/ and encourage your friends, family, and coworkers to do the same.  Stand up against hate, bigotry, and injustice.

Once you've voted, share your experience at "Twitter Vote Report":http://www.twittervotereport.com/.  Your report could save time for other voters and help pinpoint voter fraud and problematic polling places.
