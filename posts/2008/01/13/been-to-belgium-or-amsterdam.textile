h1. Been to Belgium or Amsterdam?
I'm heading to Brussels and Amsterdam in less than two weeks, and I could use some suggestions.  My travel-mates and I already have a wiki that's bursting with pubs, breweries, restaurants, bars, museums, and so forth.   What we don't have is a lot of first-hand advice about what to see.
We have four days in Brussels and five in Amsterdam.  The former is already somewhat scheduled, what with certain breweries we want to tour only being open certain days of the week.  Our time in Amsterdam is wholly unscheduled, and that's where I could use more help.
I hope to blog a fair bit of the vacation, both beer-related and otherwise.  Cheers!
