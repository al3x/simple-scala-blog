h1. Obligatory MacWorld Keynote Reaction, 2008 Edition
I'm excited about the "iPhone firmware update":http://www.macworld.com/article/131581/2008/01/iphoneupdate.html.  Good features and fixes there.  Still waitin' on that SDK announcement.
Don't care about "Apple TV":http://www.apple.com/appletv/, movie rentals, or any of the "Apple as media company" announcements.  Still not gonna pay for DRM-restricted content, nor build a home theater around it.
Don't care about the "Time Capsule":http://www.apple.com/timecapsule/ since I have a great NAS at home, although I wouldn't return it if I got one as a gift.  It would be nice if Apple allowed other network-attached storage devices to have more fine-grained control of how Time Machine backups consume disk space.
If the "MacBook Air":http://www.apple.com/macbookair/ was faster than my first-generation MacBook Pro and had better battery life, I'd order one today.  It doesn't, though, so now I'm stuck waiting for Apple to backport the Air's multi-touch trackpad and other enhancements to the MacBook Pro line.  The Air looks lovely -- perfect for business travelers -- but just not hardcore enough for my needs.   Well-positioned at the mid-point between the MacBook and MacBook Pro lines, then.
All in all a fairly disappointing keynote for me personally, but hopefully one that moves a lot of units for Apple.  Even the prospect of more devices having multi-touch input is basically enough to satiate me this year.
