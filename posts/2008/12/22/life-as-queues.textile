h1. Life As A Series of Queues

A downside of many information architectures is the reduction of data to items in queues that must be manually processed. Though information technology has saved the "knowledge work" generations from a lifetime of manual labor, we have our own assembly lines.

Here are the queues I process in a given work day:

* work email (by far the most insidious queue)
* personal email
* instant messages (they queue while in meetings and away from the computer)
* text messages
* missed phone calls and voicemail
* "@replies":http://help.twitter.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=70 on Twitter
* direct messages on Twitter
* requests for links to applications by Twitter API developers
* requests for whitelisting by Twitter developers
* code review requests
* tickets on our internal bug tracker
* tickets on the "Twitter API tracker":http://code.google.com/p/twitter-api/issues/list
* items in my personal to-do list
* calendar event requests
* unread items in my feed reader
* unread items in "Instapaper":http://www.instapaper.com

My suspicion is that there's a market in making each and every one of those queues smaller, if not making them disappear entirely.
